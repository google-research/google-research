"""Finds sufficient input subsets for an input and black-box function.

This module implements the sufficient input subsets (SIS) procedure published
in [1]. The goal of this procedure is to interpret black-box functions by
identifying minimal sets of input features whose observed values alone suffice
for the same decision to be reached, even with all other input values missing.

More precisely, presuming the function's value at an input x exceeds a
pre-specified threshold (f(x) >= threshold), this procedure identifies a
collection of sparse subsets of features in x,
SIS-collection = [sis_1, sis_2, ...] where each sis_i satisfies
f(x_sis_i) >= threshold, and x_sis_i is a variant of x where all positions
except for those in the SIS are masked.

The authors of the SIS paper [1] recommend that the threshold be selected based
on the application, e.g. by precision/recall considerations in the case f is a
classifier. Note that as the threshold is increased, the SIS become larger.
The mask is likewise pre-specified and also highly application-dependent.
In the SIS paper, the authors mask values by using a mean feature value (e.g.
a mean word embedding in natural language applications, or a mean pixel value
in image classification). Other possible masking values could include <UNK>
tokens or zero values. Regardless of choice, one should check that the
function's prediction on the fully-masked input is uninformative.

Note: this procedure allows for interpreting of any arbitrary function, not
just those stemming from machine learning applications!


  Typical usage example:

    In this example, suppose f returns the L_2 norm of its inputs. With a
    threshold of 1, the two SIS identified are [1] and [2] (where the 1 and 2
    are indices into the original input), such that if we select just these
    values (and mask all others, with the supplied all-zero mask), we have
    f([0, 10, 0]) >= 1 and f([0, 0, 5]) >= 1.

  f_l2 = lambda batch_coords: np.linalg.norm(batch_coords, ord=2, axis=-1)
  threshold = 1.0
  initial_input = np.array([0.1, 10, 5])
  fully_masked_input = np.array([0, 0, 0])
  collection = sis_collection(f_l2, threshold, initial_input,
                              fully_masked_input)


  See docstring of sis_collection for more-detailed usage information.
  Additional usage examples can be found in tests for sis_collection.

  Fields:
    sis: Array of idxs into the mask which define the sufficient input subset.
      These idxs describe the *unmasked positions* in the input. This array
      has shape (k x idx.shape), where k is the length of the SIS
      and idx is an idx into the mask. Note that in case of any ties between
      elements during backward selection, lower indices appear later in this

    ordering_over_entire_backselect: Array of shape (m x idx.shape), containing
      the order of idxs masked during backward selection while identifying this
      SIS, where 1 <= m <= d (and d is the max number of maskable positions).
      Later elements in this list were masked later during backward selection.

      Otherwise, m < d (as elements in earlier SIS are not considered again when

    values_over_entire_backselect: Array of floats of shape (m,) containing the

      of f *after* that corresponding position is masked. The length m is
      defined in the same way as in ordering_over_entire_backselect.
    mask: Boolean array of shape M that corresponds to this SIS. Applying this
      mask to the original input produces a version of the input where all

  Returns:
    A list of SISResult objects, containing the entire SIS-collection for the
      initial_input. If no SIS exists (i.e. f(initial_input) < threshold),
      returns an empty list.

    Note that we follow the convention in the SIS paper [1], where a SIS only
      exists if f(initial_input) >= threshold. If f(initial_input) < threshold,
      but there exists a subset of features on which f(subset) >= threshold, we
      do not consider this a valid SIS.

    The order of SISResults in this list corresponds to the order of the SIS as
      they are found -- the first element is the first SIS found, and so on.
      Earlier SIS are masked while finding later SIS, so all the SIS in the
      SIS-collection are disjoint (as in the SIS paper [1]).
