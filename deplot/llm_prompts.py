Q: In which year republicans have the lowest favor rate?
A: Let's find the column of republicans. Then let's extract the favor rates, they [45.0, 42.0, 38.0, 49.0, 51.2, 48.0, 41.0]. The smallest number is 38.0, that's Row 3.  Row 3 is year 2007. The answer is 2007.

Q: What is the sum of Democrats' favor rates of 2004, 2012, and 2013?
A: Let's find the rows of years 2004, 2012, and 2013. We find Row 1, 6, 7. The favor dates of Demoncrats on that 3 rows are 68.1, 70.0, and 72.0. 68.1+70.0+72=210.1. The answer is 210.1.

Q: By how many points do Independents surpass Republicans in the year of 2011?
A: Let's find the row with year = 2011. We find Row 5. We extract Independents and Republicans' numbers. They are 58.0 and 51.2. 58.0-51.2=6.8. The answer is 6.8.

Q: Which group has the overall worst performance?
A: Let's sample a couple of years. In Row 1, year 2004, we find Republicans having the lowest favor rate 45.0 (since 45.0<68.1, 45.0<53.0). In year 2006, Row 2, we find Republicans having the lowest favor rate 42.0 (42.0<58.0, 42.0<53.0). The trend continues to other years. The answer is Republicans.

Q: Which party has the second highest favor rates in 2007?
