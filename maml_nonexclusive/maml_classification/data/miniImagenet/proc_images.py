Script for converting from csv file datafiles to a directory for each image (which is how it is loaded by MAML code)

Acquire miniImagenet from Ravi & Larochelle '17, along with the train, val, and test csv files. Put the
csv files in the miniImagenet directory and put the images in the directory 'miniImagenet/images/'.
Then run this script from the miniImagenet directory:
    cd data/miniImagenet/
    python proc_images.py
