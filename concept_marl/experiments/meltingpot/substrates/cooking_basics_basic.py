"""Configuration for Cooking Basic.

Same as:
meltingpot/python/configs/substrates/collaborative_cooking_impassable.py

except here the environment is open with no obstacles. See file above for the
recipe that players must follow.

This substrate is a pure common interest game. All players share all rewards.

Players have a `5 x 5` observation window.
