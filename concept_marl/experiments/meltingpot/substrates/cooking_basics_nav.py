"""Configuration for Cooking Nav.

Same file/config structure:
meltingpot/python/configs/substrates/collaborative_cooking_impassable.py

But the environment differs from other cooking environments. Here, agents only
need to carry tomatoes to a pot. This environment is more of a sanity check
environment for learning algorithms.

The structure of this file (and how configs are handled for these environments)
follow the design patterns introduced there.
