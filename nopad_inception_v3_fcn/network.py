  Note that the output Tensors are expected to be embeddings (e.g. "PreLogits"

  accept embeddings to produce predictions; this design allows us to support
  multi-head and reusing the same network body for different predictions
  (e.g. regression and classification).

  Implementations should provide a constructor that takes parameters needed for
  the specific model.
