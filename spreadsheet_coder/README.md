## Introduction

This is a repository for code and data accompanying the ICML 2021 paper
[SPREADSHEETCODER: Formula Prediction from Semi-structured Context](TBD).

# Code

We are releasing sample code implementing the approach described in the paper.
At this point, the code is provided for illustration purposes, and is not
set up to be executed. Future modifications to this repository may make this
code runnable.


# Datasets

We are releasing a dataset that casts the Enron Spreadsheet corpus to our
representation. The original spreadsheet corpus is on (GitHub)[https://github.com/SheetJS/enron_xls].
