// For FIXED_LEN, batching will assert that all sequences are exactly
// the same length.
//
// For PAD_MAX_LEN, batching will pad those sequences in the batch that
// are shorter than the longest sequence. Only the pad_dim dimension
// can have inconsistent lengths, other dimensions have to have the
// same length. Padded values are set to be pad_value for arithmic
// types. For string tensors, no initiialization is done, for non-float
// arithmetic types, the value is cast.
//
// For PAD_FIXED_LEN, the operation is like PAD_MAX_LEN but all
// sequences are made fixed_len long. A sequence in a batch exceeding
// this length will result in a run-time error.
//
// The fixate_size field is used in conjunction with the fixed length
// options. If set, the input tensor will be reshaped to the
// fixate_size. This is required for TPU operation that needs a fully
// defined tensor size and cannot deal with a dynamic size. The Hanasu
// Op produced tensors are reported as having a dynamic size, hence an
// explicit reshape is required in that case.
