"""Beam pipeline identifying non-canonical SMILES.

We want to rely on RDKit's canonical smiles computation to lookup graphs, but
what if different smiles are generated for different orders or atoms?
This pipeline tries to identify bond topologies where ordering or atoms
produces different SMILES strings.
