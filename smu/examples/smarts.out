SMARTS patterns are convenient ways to select a subset of bond topologies
You can read about SMARTS here: https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html

The first step is to find the set of bond topology ids that match the SMARTS
We will use a SMARTS query that finds 6 membered, singly bonded carbon rings
C1CCCCC1

We use find_bond_topology_id_by_smarts to get the bt_ids
This typically takes 20-40 seconds
In this case we find 1743 matching bond topologies

You can then use find_by_bond_topology_id_list (just like indices.py) to get the conformers
In this case we find 1163 matching conformers
As you can see, not all bond topology ids in the standard database will find a matching conformer
You can always find descriptions of all bond topologies in bond_topology.csv
