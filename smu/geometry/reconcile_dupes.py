"""Parse output of topology_from_geom.

Process records with dupl.

topologies.

Input looks like:

Smiles,StartSmi,mol_id,NBts,IsStart
CCC1=NNNN1,CCC1=NNNN1,6104990001,1,True
CC(N)C(N)NN,CC(N)C(N)NN,6103750002,1,True

Use the input to create a mapping between smiles and BondTopologyId
and then scan the data again, adding the right BondTopologyId to the
found smiles.
