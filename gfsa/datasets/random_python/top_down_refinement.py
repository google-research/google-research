"""Tools to generate ASTs by iteratively refining a partial program.

This module defines an interface for weighted AST templates, and functions to
build a random AST by combining those templates until reaching a maximum size.
The set of templates defines a probabilistic grammar, where each nonterminal
includes a small amount of local context (such as variable names that are
currently in scope); we repeatedly choose nonterminals to expand subject to
the constraint that we do not exceed the maximum size.

Note that the interface is not necessarily specific to Python ASTs, but can
generate any sort of grammar-structured object.
