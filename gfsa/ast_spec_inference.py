"""Infers an automaton schema from examples.

This makes it possible to adapt a schema automatically for a dataset, by
implementing only a small translation layer.

This was used to extract a schema from the ETH Py150 Open training set.

We assume there is some set of node types, each of which has a fixed set of
fields. We classify each field as having:

a) always exactly one child
b) either zero or one child
c) a nonempty list of children
d) a sometimes-empty list of children
e) never any children

Based on this classification, we then generate a schema encoding all possible
entry and exit points for an automaton.
