"""Python object types for graphs and their corresponding POMDPs.

Section 3.1 of the paper describes a transformation from ordinary directed
graphs into POMDPs with specific observation and action spaces. The objects
defined in this file specify the Python representation of these graph POMDPs
and their action and observation spaces.

Notes on terminology:
- An "incoming edge type" represents what an agent observes when it enters a
  node by following a specific edge. Together, the set of pairs of node types
  and incoming edge types is the observation space of the agent.
- An "outgoing edge type" represents an action that an agent can take in order
  to leave a node. The set of outgoing edge types for each node type, combined
  with the set of special actions, is the action space of the agent.
- Each edge has both an incoming edge type and an outgoing edge type in addition
  to a source and destination node. This represents a single possible transition
  in the POMDP: when located at the source node and taking the action denoted by
  the out-edge type, the agent will move to the destination node and receive
  an observation based on the out-edge type.

As an example, for a graph representing an AST where B is the left child of A,
the edge from A to B might have outgoing type "left child" and incoming type
"parent"; then an agent can choose to move to the left child, and upon doing so
observes that it has arrived at that node from its parent.

class NodeSchema:
  """Specifies the set of possible input edges and output edges for a node.

  A node schema specifies the "local" observation space and action space for
  nodes of a particular type; the incoming edges are the observations that are
  possible when entering nodes of this type, and the outgoing edges are the
  movement actions that the agent can take at a node of this type.

  Note that, for each edge type in `out_edges`, a node conforming to this schema
  must have *at least one* outgoing edge of that type, so that the agent can
  take any of the allowed actions at this node. It is possible, however, to
  have loop edges that point back to this node, which results in no movement.

  Attributes:
    in_edges: Collection of edge types that can be used to enter this node.

  Due to the Markov property, the state of the agent in the environment can be
  fully represented by the current input-tagged node, which encapsulates the
  agent's position and it's current observation, along with the agent's
  finite-state memory (stored separately).

  This class is immutable so it can be used as a key in dictionaries.
