"""Utilities for working with Multiplane Images (MPIs).

A multiplane image is a set of RGB + alpha textures, positioned as fronto-
parallel planes at specific depths from a reference camera. It represents a
lightfield and can be used to render new views from nearby camera positions
by warping each texture according to its plane homography and combining the
results with an over operation. More detail at:
   https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/mpi/

In this code, an MPI is represented by a tensor of layer textures and a tensor
of depths:
  layers: [..., L, H, W, 4] -- L is the number of layers, last dimension is
          typically RGBA but it can be any number of channels as long as the
          last channel is alpha.
  depths: [..., L] -- distances of the planes from the reference camera.

Layers and depths are stored back-to-front, i.e. farthest layer ("layer 0")
comes first. Typically the depths are chosen so that the corresponding
disparities (inverse depths) form an arithmetic sequence.
