"""Geometry utilities.

In these functions:

* Shapes are known statically. Exception: functions dealing with
  points lists, whose length is data-dependent.

* Where possible, utility functions operate on the last one or two
  dimensions of their inputs, and will function irrespective of how many
  preceding dimensions are present. Where it makes sense, functions support
  broadcasting on the part of the shape preceding the fixed dimensions.
  This is to allow preceding dimensions to freely be used for batching or
  other purposes.

* Camera poses are representated as 3x4 matrices (consisting of a 3x3 rotation
  matrix and a 3-coordinate translation vector):
    [[ r r r tx ]
     [ r r r ty ]
     [ r r r tz ]]
  The matrix maps a position in world-space into a position relative to the
  camera position. (Conventionally, the camera position has the Z axis pointing
  into the screen and the Y axis pointing down.) Functions to manipulate such
  matrices have names beginning "mat34_".

* Camera intrinsics are represented as a tensor of last dimension 4. The four
  elements are fx, fy (focal length) and cx, cy (principal point). Intrinsics
  are independent of image-size, they are expressed as if the image runs from
  (0,0) to (1,1). So typically cx == cy == 0.5, and for a 90-degree field of
  view, fx == 0.5.

* Points (whether 2D or 3D) are represented using the last axis of a tensor.
  A set of N 3D points would have shape [N, 3].

* Planes in 3D are represented as 4-vectors. A point x is on the plane p exactly
  when p.x == 0.

* We use texture coordinates to represent points in an image. They go from (0,0)
  in the top-left corner of an image to (1,1) in the bottom right. It is
  convenient to work with these coordinates rather than counts of pixels,
  because they are resolution-independent.


This file is organised in the following sections:

  MATRICES, PLANES, POINTS
    – basic 3D geometry operations.

  CAMERAS
    – intrinsics, projection, camera-relative points.

  IMAGES AND SAMPLING
    – bilinear-sampling from images.

  WARPS AND HOMOGRAPHIES
    – plane sweep, homography, flow warping, depth warping.
