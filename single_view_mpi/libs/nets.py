  """Offset network outputs to ensure harmonic distribution of initial alpha.

  The first num_layers-1 channels are the ones that will become the alpha
  channels for layers [1, N-1]. (There is no channel corresponding to the alpha
  of the back layer because is it always 1.0, i.e. fully opaque.)

  We adjust these first num_layers-1 channels so that instead of all layer
  alphas having an initial mean of 0.5, the Nth layer from the back has an
  initial mean of 1/N. This harmonic distribution allows each layer to
  contribute equal weight when the layers are composed.

    channels: [..., N] Network output before final tanh activation.
    num_layers: How many layers we are predicting an MPI for.

  Returns:
