  https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00567

  Note that the unregularized transport cost for a finite iteration solution of
  the potentials f and g is a lower bound on the regularized is a lower bound
  on the regurized transport cost with a converged solution for f and g (see
  proposition 4.8 of arxiv paper).

  If you need to compute the coupling P^L from the potentials
  after a finite number of iterations L, you should put
  the coupling through a rounding operation (round_coupling) to ensure that
  the coupling is a doubly stochastic. Otherwise <C, P^L> is not a valid
  approximation of L_C(a, b). After applying the rounding_coupling function
  to P^L <-- round(P^L) you can then use < C, P^L> as a valid approximation.

  Args:
   a: np.ndarray<float>[n]: discrete probability distribution. The rows of the
     coupling matrix P must sum up to this vector. If a represents an empirical
     distribution with n samples, all entries should be equal to 1/n.
   b: np.ndarray<float>[m]: discrete probability distribution. The columns of
     the coupling matrix P must sum up to this vector. If b represents an
     empirical distribution with m samples, all entries should be equal to 1/m.
   cost: np.ndarray<float>[n, m]: the cost matrix cost[i,j] = c(x_i, y_j) where
     x_i and y_j are samples from distributions a and b respectively.
   epsilon: (float) the level of entropic regularization wanted.
