r"""Parallel BLEU score calculation.

This version of BLEU calculation is derived from the MLPerf transformer
reference.
Tries to match SacreBLEU metric reasonably well, but is not identical.

Refs:
    tokenizer at:
    https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/transformer/utils/tokenizer.py
    original preprocessing tokenizer:
    https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/generic/mteval-v14.pl#L954-L983
    original t2t code:
    https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/blob/master/tensor2tensor/utils/bleu_hook.py

Usage:
    refs = '''food bar brown cow
    blee bloo dog sat
    or please take me out
    '''
    hyps = '''foo bar brown cow
    blee bloo dog sit
    please do take me out
    '''
    bleu_local(refs.split("\n"), hyps.split("\n"))  # 39.65

  See https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/'
           'blob/master/scripts/generic/mteval-v14.pl#L954-L983
  In our case, the input string is expected to be just one line
  and no HTML entities de-escaping is needed.
  So we just tokenize on punctuation and symbols,
  except when a punctuation is preceded and followed by a digit
  (e.g. a comma/dot as a thousand/decimal separator).

  Note that a number (e.g. a year) followed by a dot at the end of sentence
  is NOT tokenized, i.e. the dot stays with the number because
  `s/(\p{P})(\P{N})/ $1 $2/g` does not match this case (unless we add a
  space after each sentence). However, this error is already in the
  original mteval-v14.pl and we want to be consistent with it.
