"""Fit TEL on the Boston Housing regression dataset."""
# We will fit TEL on the Boston Housing regression dataset.
# First, load the dataset.
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import boston_housing
# Make sure the tf_trees directory is in the search path.

from tensorflow import keras

# The documentation of TEL can be accessed as follows
print(TEL.__doc__)

# Define the tree layer; here we choose 10 trees, each of depth 3.
# Note output_logits_dim is the dimension of the tree output.
# output_logits_dim = 1 in this case, but should be equal to the
# number of classes if used as an output layer in a classification task.
tree_layer = TEL(output_logits_dim=1, trees_num=10, depth=3)

# Construct a sequential model with batch normalization and TEL.

# Fit a model with mse loss.
