  This wraps a layer of components by adding appropriately placed identities.
  It allows for a view of the routing proccess where a single input is routed
  through a subset of components, and then aggregated. This is in contrast to
  the default behavior of the pathnet library, where routing happens at the end
  of each component independently.

  Args:
    components: (list) components to route through.
    router: the router used to select the components. It should have
      a `__call__` method with the same arguments as the routers defined
      in pathnet_lib.
    router_out: the router used to route the final output. It should have
      a `__call__` method with the same arguments as the routers defined
      in pathnet_lib.
    combiner: the combiner used to aggregate the outputs.
    in_shape: (sequence of ints) input shape.

    sparse: (bool) whether to set the `sparse` flag for the components layer.
