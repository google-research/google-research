  These are the non-exponentiated gammas.  We produce this eval_gammas
  sequence in a way that when the largest eval_gamma is exponentiated, the
  largest gamma being learned via Bellman updates is approximately equal
  to self.gamma_max.

  We can see that if we use a power-method for choosing the gamma interval,
  the base b must satisfy the relation,

        (1. - b ^ N) ^ k = \gamma_max

  where N is the number of gammas, k is the hyperbolic exponent.  The base b
  to use is then solved as

        b = exp[ ln(1. - \gamma_max ^ (1 \ k)) / N]

  Args:
    gamma_max:  The maximum gamma to use in Bellman equations.
    hyp_exponent:  The k-coefficient for hyperbolic discounting.
    number_of_gammas:  Number of gammas to simultaneously model.
