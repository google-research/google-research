def soft_hot_layer(offsets, scales):
  """Embedding layer for scalar observations.

  For each input scalar, produces an embedding vector.

  Args:
    offsets: Matrix of shape `[input_dim, soft_hot_dim]` which contains the
        soft-hot "offset" for the i-th scalar input and j-th soft-hot feature.
        `input_dim` is the number of scalar inputs, and `soft_hot_dim` is the
        number of soft-hot features (output dim).
    scales: Array of shape `[input_dim]` which contains the soft-hot scales, one
        for each input scalar.

  Returns:
    tf.keras.layers.Layer object. This layer converts a tensor of shape
    `[..., input_dim]` to a tensor of shape `[..., input_dim*soft_hot_dim]`,
    which is a concat of the soft-hot embeddings for each input scalar.

    batch: (usage 1) A batch of data, with which to extract the input feature
        statistics. Automatically calculates `bounds` and `variance` arguments
        under the hood from `batch`.
    bounds: (usage 2) List of 2-tuples, giving the min and max values expected
        for each input feature. Values out of bounds are allowed, but may be
        difficult to distinguish from min and max values. Set higher `spillover`
        to accomidate out-of-bounds values.
    variance: (usage 2) List of variances of each input feature. This sets the
        width of the Gaussian kernels used by `soft_hot_layer`.
