class ImageProducer(object):
  """An image producer that puts images into a staging area periodically.

  This class is useful for periodically running a set of ops, `put_ops` on a
  different thread every `batch_group_size` steps.

  The notify_image_consumption() method is used to increment an internal counter
  so that every `batch_group_size` times it is called, `put_ops` is executed. A
  barrier is placed so that notify_image_consumption() will block until
  the previous call to `put_ops` has been executed.

  The start() method is used to start the thread that runs `put_ops`.

  The done() method waits until the last put_ops is executed and stops the
  thread.

  The purpose of this class is to fill an image input pipeline every
  `batch_group_size` steps. Suppose `put_ops` supplies `batch_group_size` images
  to the input pipeline when run, and that every step, 1 batch of images is
  consumed. Then, by calling notify_image_consumption() every step, images are
  supplied to the input pipeline at the same amount they are consumed.

  Example usage:
  ```
  put_ops = ... # Enqueues `batch_group_size` batches to a StagingArea
  get_op = ...  # Dequeues 1 batch, and does some operations on it
  batch_group_size = 4
  with tf.Session() as sess:
    image_producer = cnn_util.ImageProducer(sess, put_op, batch_group_size)
    image_producer.start()
