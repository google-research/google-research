  Args:
    all_reduce_spec: a string specifying a combination of all-reduce
      algorithms to apply for gradient reduction.

  Returns:
    a list of AllReduceSpecTuple.

  Raises:
    ValueError: all_reduce_spec is not well-formed.

  An all_reduce_spec has BNF form:
     int ::= positive whole number
     g_int ::= int[KkMGT]?
     alg_spec ::= alg | alg#int
     range_spec ::= alg_spec | alg_spec/alg_spec
     spec ::= range_spec | range_spec:g_int:range_spec

  Not all syntactically correct specifications are supported.
  Examples of supported all_reduce_spec strings, with semantics explained:

    'collective' == apply tf.collective_reduce operator to all tensors.
    'collective#2' == apply tf.collective_reduce operator to all tensors,
            requesting up to 2 simultaneous transfers at each node, if
            feasible, by subdividing tensor by an additional factor of 2.
    'xring' == apply ring all-reduce to all tensors
    'xring#2' == apply ring all-reduce to all tensors, using two simultaneous
            transfer rings, each operating on 1/2 of each tensor.
    'nccl'  == apply NCCL all-reduce to all tensors (only works within
            a single worker process where all devices are GPUs)
    'nccl/xring' == apply NCCL all-reduce to all tensors within each worker
            to produce at least one full-reduced (locally) value,
            then apply ring all-reduce to one such value from each
            worker, then apply NCCL broadcast to propagate those globally
            reduced values back to every device within each worker.
    'pscpu' == Shuffle reduce using worker CPUs as the gather devices: each
            distributed tensor is reduced by copying all instances to
            one of the worker CPUs, computing the reduction there, then
            copying back to each participating device.  Tensor reductions
            are assigned to specific CPUs round-robin.
    'psgpu#4' == Arrange all GPUs across all workers into groups of 4.
            Each distributed tensor is shuffle reduced against one
            such group of 4 GPUs, selected round-robin.  That is, each
            tensor is split across 4 shards for the reduction.
    'pscpu:2k:pscpu#2:64k:xring' == Apply single-shard pscpu to
            tensors of size <= 2048 elements, apply 2-shard pscpu to
            tensors up to size 64k elements, apply xring to larger tensors.
    'pscpu/pscpu#2' == Use shuffle gather to locally reduce each tensor on
            the worker's CPU, then use 2-shard shuffle to reduce those
            locally reduced tensors across workers (on the worker CPUs), then
            scatter the globally reduced values locally from each worker CPU.

  """Concatenate small gradient tensors together for reduction.

  Args:
    tower_grads: List of lists of (gradient, variable) tuples.
    max_bytes: Int giving max number of bytes in a tensor that
      may be considered small.
    max_group: Int giving max number of small tensors that may be
      concatenated into one new tensor.

  Returns:
    new_tower_grads, packing where new_tower_grads is identical to
      tower_grads except that all feasible small_tensors have been removed
      from their places and concatenated into larger tensors that are
      now in the front of the list for each tower, and packing contains
      the data necessary to restore the tower_grads structure.

  Look through the first tower for gradients of the same type (float),
  and small size, that are all sequential.  For each such group,
  replace by a new tensor that is a flattened concatenation.  Note
  that the corresponding variable will be absent, which doesn't matter
  because it isn't used during all-reduce.

  Requires:
    Every gv_list in towers must have isomorphic structure including identical
      tensor sizes and types.
