"""Benchmarks the all-reduce algorithms of tf_cnn_benchmarks.

tf_cnn_benchmarks uses all-reduce to aggregate gradients. This benchmark is
useful for benchmarking the performance of just this gradient aggregation,
instead of the entire model. All the flags that tf_cnn_benchmarks accepts are
also accepted by this script, although many are silently ignored.

The number and shapes of the tensors all-reduced are those of the variables of
the model specified by the --model flag.
TODO(reedwm): Allow custom sizes to be specified.
