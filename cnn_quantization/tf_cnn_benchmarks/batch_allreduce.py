"""Contains classes and functions for doing a single-machine batch all-reduce.

An all-reduce is taking the reduction (typically a sum) of a list of tensors,
each on a different device. The result must end up back on each device, which is
where the word "all" comes from. In summary, each device starts with a single
tensor, and ends up with the reduction of all tensors.

A batch all-reduce is doing several independent all-reduces. When doing a batch
all-reduce, care is taken to evenly distribute the reduction computations
across devices and inter-device tensor transfers across device links.

    The reduction done is a sum.

    `all_device_tensors` is a list of list of tensors that will be batch
    all-reduced. All tensors within a single inner list must be on the same
    device. The nth element in each list, for any n, will be reduced together.
    The return value is in the same form as `all_device_tensors`, except that
    each tensor is reduced.

    For example, if `all_device_tensors` is:
    [[ A,  B  ],     # A and B are on GPU 0
     [ C,  D  ]]     # C and D are on GPU 1

    Then the return value will be:

     [ A+C,  B+D ]]  # These two tensors are on GPU 1

    Arguments:
      all_device_tensors: A list of list of tensors. `all_device_tensors[i][j]`
        is a tensor where `i` is the device index and `j` is the tensor index.
      num_splits: If not None, tensors will be concatenated and split into this
        many pieces during the all-reduce, then split back into their original
        shapes afterwards. Has no impact on correctness and can improve
        performance. Requires all tensors to be the same type.
      compact_tensors: If True, tensors are casted to fp16 before being all-
        reduced. Improves performance, but hurts numerical stability.
      defer_tensors: If True, every time the return value
        `reduced_all_device_tensors` is evaluated, the result will be the
        reduced tensors values of `all_device_tensors` from the previous session
        run instead of the current session run, or zero on the first session
        run. This can improve performance. When training neural networks,
        deferring gradients often does not harm training, so this can be used to
        improve performance.
