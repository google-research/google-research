"""Re-implementation of the DS2 encoder (Amodei et al., 2016).

Made to be compatible with Open Seq2Seq implementation (Kuchaev et al., 2018).

The architecture is compatible with the original weights and architecture, but
had to be re-implemented because the original checkpoint metagraph relied on
CuDNN for GRUs and was impossible to run on other accelerators.
