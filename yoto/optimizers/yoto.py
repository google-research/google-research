    model is trained conditional on these loss weights.

      problem: An instance of the Problem class, defining the learning problem
        to be solved.

        specifying the weight distribution.
      extra_inputs_preprocessing: TransformType enum value that specifies the
        pre-processing to be applied to the loss weights before they are fed
        to the model for conditioning.
      weights_per_sample: Bool. If True, the loss weights are sampled per
        training sample, otherwise - per training mini-batch.
