"""Keras-based ConvNet with additional conditioning inputs.

Currently the network is conditioned on extra input vector with something like
conditional batch normalization, but without batch normalization.
For each hidden layer its output h_i is element-wise multiplied
by a vector m_i and element-wise summed with a vector a_i, both m_i and a_i
predicted with MLPs from the conditioning input.
