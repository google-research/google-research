# There is no SessionCreator that supports this naively, so I am hacking
# in a reset op into the check for ready
# I don't know what will happen in the case that i can't just span this
# init function (as is the case with random initializations).
# This should be fixed with a new session creator that
# calls an init op,
# then waits for remote variables to be initialized.
