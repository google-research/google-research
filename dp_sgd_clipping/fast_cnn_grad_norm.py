"""This is a library for fast and memory efficient gradient norm computation.

The functions operate on a single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layer and
take as input one sample of the batch and the corresponding partial gradient.
The sample is assumed to be a 2D matrix whose rows correspond o the 1D vectors
of the different input channels.The partial gradient is assumed to be a 2D
matrix whose rows correspond to the 1D vectors of the different output channels.
The other two args are the kernel size and stride of the layer.
