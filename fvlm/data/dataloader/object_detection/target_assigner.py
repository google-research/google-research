"""Base target assigner module.

The job of a TargetAssigner is, for a given set of anchors (bounding boxes) and
groundtruth detections (bounding boxes), to assign classification and regression
targets to each anchor as well as weights to each anchor (specifying, e.g.,
which anchors should not contribute to training loss).

It assigns classification/regression targets by performing the following steps:
1) Computing pairwise similarity between anchors and groundtruth boxes using a
  provided RegionSimilarity Calculator
2) Computing a matching based on the similarity matrix using a provided Matcher
3) Assigning regression targets based on the matching and a provided BoxCoder
4) Assigning classification targets based on the matching and groundtruth labels

Note that TargetAssigners only operate on detections from a single
image at a time, so any logic for applying a TargetAssigner to multiple
images must be handled externally.
