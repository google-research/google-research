    batch_size: the global batch size.
    feature_names: a sequence of feature names to select from the dataset.
    label_names: the label names to be passed to loss function/metrics.
    preprocess_fn: a function from tf.data.Dataset to tf.data.Dataset to do any
      pre-processing needed on the dataset object. NOTE: this is different from
        the map_fn that maps the dataset contents.
    postprocess_fn: a function from tf.data.Dataset to tf.data.Dataset to do any
      post-processing needed on the dataset object. NOTE: this is different from
        the map_fn that maps the dataset contents.
    filter_fn: the predicate function to filter the contents of the dataset.
    map_fn: a function that operates on individual items in the dataset. NOTE:
      this is called before batching hence it operates on a per example basis.
    batch_map_fn: like `map_fn` but it is called after batching. It is useful
      for processing a batch of data instead of individual data points (e.g.
      cutmix or mixup).
    flatten: whether to flatten the output of `map_fn`. It is used when the map
      function produces N examples (where N is the leading dimension) and we
      want to produce N separate elements from it. NOTE: this option is
        generally preferred over the use of `unbatch` because of performance
      issues. Please see:
      https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset#unbatch
    repeat: whether to repeat the data indefinitely.
    shuffle: whether to shuffle the examples.
    shuffle_multiplier: Specifies the buffer size for shuffling which will be
      per_replica_batch * shuffle_multiplier.
    cache: whether to cache the dataset in memory.
    iterator_type: Type of iterator to return. Numpy for Colab demo, tfds for
      normal training and evaluation.
    ignore_errors: Set to true to ignore errors and drop samples that fail
      processing.
    unbatch: bool, set to True to unbatch data before making batches. Useful for
      data like VQA where there are multiple questions per image that need to be
      unbatched then batched into equal sizes.
    vocab: Optional vocab to use to process data. Passes in a vocab argument to
      the map function if needed.
    return_dataset: bool, set to True to return the dataset before batching and
      splitting to local devices.

  Returns:
    If return_dataset is True, a tf.data.Dataset after all the transformations.
    If return_dataset if False, returns a generator that yields a tuple of
    (features, labels) if labels is set, otherwise it yields the features as a
    list of values. Both features and labels are ready for `pmap` functions,
