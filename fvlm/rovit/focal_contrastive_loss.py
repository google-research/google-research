  Implementation follows:
  1. tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits
  2. third_party/cloud_tpu/models/detection/modeling/losses.py

  Args:
   logits: [batch, length, num_classes] float array.
   targets: categorical targets [batch, length] int array.
   alpha: A float32 scalar multiplying alpha to the loss from positive examples
     and (1-alpha) to the loss from negative examples.
   gamma: A float32 scalar modulating loss from hard and easy examples.
   loss_normalizing_factor: Constant to divide loss by. If not specified, loss
     will not be normalized. Intended for backward compatibility with T5-MTF
     training. Should not normally be used.

  Returns:
    A scalar loss.
