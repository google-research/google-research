  """Generates an Optax transformation that selects the best proposed update.

  Note on tx: In the JAX ecosystem, it is customary to refer to the gradient
  transformation as tx.

  Args:
    optimize_state: Parameters for the optimize stage.
    optimize_init_fn: A function that initializes the state object of the
      optimize step.
    optimize_update_fn: A function that chooses the most promising proposed
      update.

  Returns:
    An Optax transformation object consisting of a pair of functions that
    encode how to initialize the optimization state and how to select the best
    proposed update.
