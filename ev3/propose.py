  Note on tx: In the JAX ecosystem, it is customary to refer to the gradient
  transformation as tx.

  Args:
    propose_state: Parameters for the propose stage.
    propose_init_fn: A function that initializes the state object of the propose
      step.
    propose_update_fn: A function that proposes model updates.

  Returns:
    An Optax transformation object consisting of a pair of functions that
    encode how to initialize the proposal state and how to generate proposed
    updates.
