  """Generates an Optax transformation that decides how to evolve the model(s).

  Note on tx: In the JAX ecosystem, it is customary to refer to the gradient
  transformation as tx.

  Args:
    decide_state: Parameters for the decide stage.
    decide_init_fn: A function that initializes the state object of the decide
      step.
    decide_update_fn: A function that decides how to update the model given the
      most promising update generated by the propose and optimize stages.

  Returns:
    An Optax transformation object consisting of a pair of functions that
    encode how to initialize the decision state and how to evolve the model(s)
    being optimized.
