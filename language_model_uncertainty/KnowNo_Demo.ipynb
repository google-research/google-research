        "[KnowNo](https://robot-help.github.io) is a framework for measuring and aligning the uncertainty of LLM-based planners, such that they know when they don't know, and ask for help when needed. KnowNo builds on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on task completion while minimizing human help.\n",

        "* Instead of setting up the scenario distribution here, we will load a dataset sampled from a pre-defined scenario distribution involving the mobile robot, the same used in the experiments. We will also use calibration results already computed with the distribution.\n",
        "* We use [GPT-3.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) (text-davinci-003) as the language model here.\n",

        "\n",
        "Disclaimer: We fine the GPT3.5 model significantly underperforms [PaLM2-L](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/) model used in our experiments, largely due to its bias towards option C and D over option A and B in multiple choice question answering. We also find such bias dependent on the context, so adjusting bias for certain options in the API call does not help significantly."
