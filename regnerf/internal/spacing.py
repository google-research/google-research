def genspace(start, stop, num, fn=None):
  """A generalization of linspace(), geomspace(), and NeRF's "lindisp".

  Behaves like jnp.linspace(), except it allows an optional function that
  "curves" the values to make the spacing between samples not linear.
  If no `fn` value is specified, genspace() is equivalent to jnp.linspace().
  If fn=jnp.log, genspace() is equivalent to jnp.geomspace().
  If fn=jnp.reciprocal, genspace() is equivalent to NeRF's "lindisp".

  Args:
    start: float tensor. The starting value of each sequence.
    stop: float tensor. The end value of each sequence.
    num: int. The number of samples to generate for each sequence.
    fn: function. A jnp function handle used to curve `start`, `stop`, and the
      intermediate samples.

  Returns:
    A tensor of length `num` spanning [`start`, `stop`], according to `fn`.
