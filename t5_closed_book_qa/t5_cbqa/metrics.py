  """Computes the recall based on the Natural Questions evaluation script.

  We first remove any targets that do not contain "gold answers", which are
  defined as having at least `non_null_threshold` annotations with non-empty
  answers (either short or yes/no). For examples with gold answers, we count the
  prediction as correct if the (unordered) set of answers matches those in any
  of the annotations.

  Args:
    targets: list of lists of answer group tuples
    predictions: list of lists each containing single answer group tuple
    non_null_threshold: int, the minimum number of non-null annotations.
    normalize_answers: bool, whether to normalize answer strings before
      comparing.
  Returns:
    a dict containing the recall
