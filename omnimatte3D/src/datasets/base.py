  """Dataset Base Class.

  # Adopted from
  https://github.com/google-research/multinerf/blob/main/internal/datasets.py
  Base class for datasets.
  Each subclass is responsible for loading images data from disk by
  implementing the _load_renderings() method. This data is used to generate
  train and test batches.
  The public interface mimics the behavior of a standard machine learning
  pipeline dataset provider that can provide infinite batches of data to the
  training/testing pipelines without exposing any details of how the batches
  are loaded/created or how this is parallelized. Therefore, the initializer
  runs all setup, including data loading from disk using _load_renderings(), and
  begins the thread using its parent start() method. After the initializer
  returns, the caller can request batches of data straight away.
  The internal self._queue is initialized as queue.Queue(3), so the infinite
  loop in run() will block on the call self._queue.put(self._next_fn()) once
  there are 3 elements. The main thread training job runs in a loop that pops
  1 element at a time off the front of the queue. The Dataset thread's run()
  loop will populate the queue with 3 elements, then wait until a batch has been
  removed and push one more onto the end.
  This repeats indefinitely until the main thread's training loop completes
  (typically hundreds of thousands of iterations), then the main thread will
  exit and the Dataset thread will automatically be killed since it is a
  daemon.
  Attributes:
    size: int, number of images in the dataset.
    split: str, indicate if the split is train or test.
