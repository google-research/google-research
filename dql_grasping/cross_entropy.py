"""Cross-entropy method for continuous optimization.

Given some parametric family of sampling densities, the cross-entropy method
will adaptively select a set of parameters that minimizes the KL divergence
(cross-entropy) between the sampling distribution and points with high objective
function value.

  Definition of 'sample batches':
  This function operates on 'sample batches' returned by sample_fn and received
  by objective_fn and update_fn. Sample batches can be either represented as
  lists `[x0, ..., xn]` of n samples or as dicts that map `str` keys to sample
  lists.

  Args:
    sample_fn: A sampling function that produces samples from some
      distribution. Inputs are arbitrary parameters `**params` to the sampling
      function; output is a sample batch as specified above.
    objective_fn: An objective function to evaluate the sampled points. Input is
      a sample batch as specified above; output is a list of scalars
      `[v0, ..., vn]` representing the objective function evaluated at the
      sampled points.
    update_fn: An update function that chooses new parameters to the sampling
      function. Inputs are a dictionary `params` representing the current
      parameters to the sampling function and a (elite) sample batch as
      specified above`; outputs is a dictionary `updated_params` representing
      the updated parameters to the sampling function.
    initial_params: A dictionary of initial parameters to the sampling function.
    num_elites: The number of elite samples to pass on to the update function.
    num_iterations: The number of iterations to perform.
    threshold_to_terminate: When provided, the function may terminate earlier
        than specified num_iterations if the best inference value is greater
        than threshold_to_terminate.

  Returns:
    final_samples: The final list of sampled points `[x0, ..., xn]`.
    final_values: The final list of scalars `[v0, ..., vn]` representing the
      objective function evaluated at the sampled points.
    final_params: A dictionary of final parameters to the sampling function.
