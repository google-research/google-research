      sess: `tf.Session`, for executing ops.
      num_actions: int, number of actions the agent can take at any state.
      observation_shape: tuple of ints describing the observation shape.
      observation_dtype: tf.DType, specifies the type of the observations. Note
        that if your inputs are continuous, you should set this to tf.float32.
      stack_size: int, number of frames to use in state stack.
      network: tf.Keras.Model, expecting 2 parameters: num_actions,
        network_type. A call to this object will return an instantiation of the
        network provided. The network returned can be run with different inputs
        to create different outputs. See
        dopamine.discrete_domains.atari_lib.NatureDQNNetwork as an example.
      num_atoms: int, the number of buckets of the value function distribution.
      vmax: float, the value distribution support is [-vmax, vmax].
      gamma: float, discount factor with the usual RL meaning.
      update_horizon: int, horizon at which updates are performed, the 'n' in
        n-step update.
      min_replay_history: int, number of transitions that should be experienced
        before the agent begins training its value function.
      update_period: int, period between DQN updates.
      target_update_period: int, update period for the target network.
      epsilon_fn: function expecting 4 parameters:
        (decay_period, step, warmup_steps, epsilon). This function should return
        the epsilon value used for exploration during training.
      epsilon_train: float, the value to which the agent's epsilon is eventually
        decayed during training.
      epsilon_eval: float, epsilon used when evaluating the agent.
      epsilon_decay_period: int, length of the epsilon decay schedule.
      replay_scheme: str, 'prioritized' or 'uniform', the sampling scheme of the
        replay memory.
      tf_device: str, Tensorflow device on which the agent's graph is executed.
      use_staging: bool, when True use a staging area to prefetch the next
        training batch, speeding training up by about 30%.
      optimizer: tf.train.Optimizer, for training the value function.
      summary_writer: SummaryWriter object for outputting training statistics.
        Summary writing disabled if set to None.
      summary_writing_frequency: int, frequency with which summaries will be
        written. Lower values will result in slower training.
