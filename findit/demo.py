  Args:
    features: A three-tuple of (image, labels, text):
      image - A float array of normalized image of shape [1, normalized_height,
        [normalized_width, 3].
      labels - A dictionary of tensors used for training. The following are the
        {key: value} pairs in the dictionary.
        image_info - A 2D `Tensor` that encodes the information of the image and
          the applied preprocessing. It is in the format of
          [[original_height, original_width], [scaled_height, scaled_width],
        anchor_boxes - An ordered dictionary with keys
          [min_level, min_level+1, ..., max_level]. The values are tensor with
          shape [height_l, width_l, 4] representing anchor boxes at each level.
        groundtruths - A dictionary with keys
          source_id - Groundtruth source id.
          height - Original image height.
          width - Original image width.
          boxes - Groundtruth bounding box annotations. The box is represented
             in [y1, x1, y2, x2] format. The coordinates are w.r.t the scaled
             image that is fed to the network. The tennsor is padded with -1 to
             the fixed dimension [self._max_num_instances, 4].
          classes - Groundtruth classes annotations. The tennsor is padded
            with -1 to the fixed dimension [self._max_num_instances].
          areas - Box area or mask area depend on whether mask is present.
          is_crowds - Whether the ground truth label is a crowd label.
          num_groundtruths - Number of ground truths in the image.
      text - A tokenized texts array of shape
        (1, num_boxes, num_expressions, sentence_length)
    model_fn: A flax.deprecated.nn.module of forward model to use.

  Returns:
    model_outputs: A dictionary of model_outputs.
