  See https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/dropout.
  This version differs in that the seed is required if the rate is nonzero.

  Args:
    x: A floating point tensor.
    rate: A scalar `Tensor` with the same type as x. The probability that each
      element is dropped. For example, setting rate=0.1 would drop 10% of input
      elements.
    seed: A shape [2] integer Tensor of seeds to the random number generator.
      Must have dtype `tf.int32` when compiling to XLA.
    noise_shape: A 1-D `Tensor` of type `int32`, representing the shape for
      randomly generated keep/drop flags.
    name: A name for this operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A `Tensor` of the same shape of `x`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If `rate` is not in `[0, 1)` or if `x` is not a floating point
      tensor. `rate=1` is disallowed, because the output would be all zeros,
      which is likely not what was intended.
