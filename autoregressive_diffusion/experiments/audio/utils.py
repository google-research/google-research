  """Creates learning rate schedule.

  Interprets factors in the factors string which can consist of:
  * constant: interpreted as the constant value,
  * linear_warmup: interpreted as linear warmup until warmup_steps,
  * rsqrt_decay: divide by square root of max(step, warmup_steps)
  * rsqrt_normalized_decay: divide by square root of max(step/warmup_steps, 1)
  * decay_every: Every k steps decay the learning rate by decay_factor.
  * cosine_decay: Cyclic cosine decay, uses steps_per_cycle parameter.

  Args:
    factors: Factors separated by '*' that defines the schedule.
    base_learning_rate: Starting constant for the lr schedule.
    warmup_steps: How many steps to warm up for in the warmup schedule.
    decay_factor: Amount to decay the learning rate by.
    steps_per_decay: How often to decay the learning rate.
    steps_per_cycle: Steps per cycle when using cosine decay.

  Returns:
    A function learning_rate(step): float -> {'learning_rate': float}, the
    step-dependent lr.
