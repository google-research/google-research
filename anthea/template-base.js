      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, you will be shown translations of different documents
        that you will review and annotate for errors and issues. You will
        annotate by selecting spans of words affected by errors, then labeling
        them with severities and issue types. The goal of this project is to
        evaluate the quality of various human and machine translation outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content for annotation consists of documents that are broken down
        into parallel segments. A segment may be one sentence, multiple
        sentences, an entire paragraph, or an entire document. You will be able
        to read and annotate each segment in steps of groups of sentences (on
        both the source side and the translation side). Navigation through the
        document is explained in detail in the "Navigation" subsection.
      </p>
      `,
    'General Guidelines': `
      <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        The standard you should be reviewing the translations against is
        <b>human translation quality</b>. Report every occurrence where the
        translation falls short of that standard. Remember that the content you
        are reviewing may be a human translation or a machine translation.
        <b><i>Apply the same standard regardless</i></b>. The translation should
        be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Linguistically correct</li>
        <li>Accurate</li>
        <li>Readable (fluent, grammatically correct, and natural-sounding)</li>
        <li>With terminology appropriate in the context</li>
        <li>Consistent</li>
        <li>Faithful in tone and register to the source</li>
        <li>Appropriately transformed for the target context: cultural
            references or humor should be substituted with equivalents in
            the target language where appropriate (e.g. it's raining cats and
            dogs \u2192 it's pouring).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please be mindful of the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Before you start annotating, please read carefully the definitions
          for severities and error/issue types. Be sure to follow these
          definitions so that we can have consistency between annotators, and
          reliable results. In particular, it is important to understand the
          difference between “Major” and “Minor” severities and how to
          label text spans that cover the issue identified.
        </li>
        <li>
          We deliberately use the terms "error" and "issue" interchangeably in
          these instructions. Most issues with translations are also errors,
          but occasionally, an issue may or may not be perceived as an error,
          depending upon the application, domain, and/or subjective preferences.
        </li>
        <li>Please take document context into account when annotating:
          <ul>
            <li>If a translation might be questionable on its own but is
                acceptable in the context of the document, then it should not be
                considered as an error. For example, a noun may get replaced
                by a pronoun in the translation even though a noun was used in
                the source, and unless this change makes the translation awkward
                to read, it should not be marked as an error.</li>
            <li>Similarly, it is OK for the translation to make use of the
                context to omit some part of the source text that is obvious
                from the context (even if it is not omitted in the source text).
                For example, an adjective may not have to be repeated in the
                translated text, if it is naturally obvious from the context.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          When identifying issues, please be as fine-grained as possible. If a
          sentence contains multiple words that are independently mistranslated,
          separate errors should be recorded. For example, if “boathouses” is
          translated to “hangar de bateaux” in French, mark separate errors for
          “hangar” (should not be singular) and “de” (wrong preposition).
        </li>
        <li>
          If the same error occurs more than once in a particular document or
          even in a sentence, all occurrences should be reported. For
          consistency problems, assume that the <b>first</b> instance of a set
          of inconsistent entities is correct, and label any subsequent entities
          that are inconsistent with it as errors. For example, if a text
          contains “Doctor Smith … Dr. Smith … Doctor Smith … Dr. Smith”, the
          2nd and 4th occurrences should be marked.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the whole translation of a sentence is so bad that all or nearly
          all of it is completely wrong (e.g., word salad, completely
          nonsensical output, severely broken syntax), then apply the “Major”
          severity and pick the error type “Non-translation!”. Note that picking
          Non-translation! will automatically select the whole sentence as the
          error span, even if you had selected a subspan to start with.
        </li>
      </ol>
      `,
    'Navigation': `
      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        Each task consists of text from a single document alongside its
        translation. Sometimes it can be a very short document (even a single
        sentence), but typically a document will have 10-20 sentences.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        You will go through a document in convenient steps of small
        "sub-paragraphs" (groups of consecutive sentences from the same
        paragraph). You can move from one sub-paragraph to the next (and back)
        using the arrow keys or using the buttons labeled with left and right
        arrows. Note that these sub-paragraphs are automatically created on the
        source side and the translation side, <i>independently</i> of each
        other, purely for convenient navigation through potentially long
        documents. In particular, they are <i>not</i> expected to be
        aligned—i.e., the translation of the third (say) sub-paragraph on the
        source side need not be exactly just the third sub-paragraph on the
        translation side.
        </li>
        <li>
        If the document was translated in steps of segments that were smaller
        than the whole document, then at the end of the last sub-paragraph on
        the source side of each segment, the right arrow key/button will take
        you to the start (i.e., the first sub-paragraph) of the translation of
        that segment. And, at the end of the translation side of that segment,
        it will take you to the start of the source side of the next segment.
        </li>
        <li>
        If the entire document was translated as one segment, then the right
        arrow key/button will take you to the start of the translation only at
        the end of the source side of the whole document.
        </li>
        <li>
        If a source segment appears to be too long, you can (at any time) choose
        to jump to the translation side after reading some part of the source,
        using the Tab key. The Tab key will similarly allow you to jump back to
        the source side from the translation side. We leave the judgment to you,
        as to how to divide your annotation process for long segments into
        smaller units.
        </li>
        <li>
        You can also use the left arrow key/button to go <i>back</i> through the
        sub-paragraphs and segments. You can also directly click on any
        previously read part of the text to jump back to it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      `,
    'Annotation Process': `
      <h2>Annotation Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Review the translation of each segment against the source, following
            the general guidelines above.</li>
        <li>
          Select the <b>span</b> of words affected by the issue by clicking on
          the word/particle where the identified issue “begins”, then clicking
          on the word/particle where the issue “ends”. If it is only one word,
          then you have to click on it twice.
          <ul>
            <li>The marked span should be the minimal contiguous sequence such
                that modifying the word(s) within the span, deleting the span,
                or moving the word(s) somewhere else in the sentence will remove
                the identified issue. The span should not include adjoining
                words that are not directly affected by the identified issue and
                do not need to be modified in order for the issue to be
                fixed.</li>
            <li>You can only mark spans within sentences. In the rare case that
                an error straddles multiple sentences (e.g., when there is an
                incorrect sentence break), just mark the first part of the span
                that lies within a sentence.</li>
            <li>The shorter the span, the more useful it is.</li>
            <li>When it comes to "Style/Unnatural or awkward" errors, please
                pinpoint the error rather than extend the span to an entire
                clause.</li>
            <li>If a single issue affects words that do not directly follow each
                other, as is the case with split verbs in German
                (“teilte die Feuerwehr auf”) or phrasal verbs in English
                (“called Mary and her brother up”), log the issue only for the
                first part (“teilte”, “called”) and do not log anything for the
                latter part (“auf”, “up”). The text between “teilte” and “auf”,
                or between “called” and “up”, should not be included in the span
                if the issue is with the verb only (“aufteilen”, “call up”).
            </li>
            <li>Note: issues can appear either on the translation side, or
                rarely, for the "Source issue" type, on the source side. When
                the error is an omission, the error span must be selected on the
                source side.</li>
          </ul>

        <li>
          Select the <b>severity</b> of the issue using the buttons in the
          rightmost column ("Evaluations") or their keyboard shortcuts:
          <ul>
            <li>Major severity (M)</li>
            <li>Minor severity (m)</li>
          </ul>

        <li>Select the <b>category</b> (also called <b>type</b>) and
            <b>subcategory</b> (also called <b>subtype</b>) of the error/issue
            found. For example: Accuracy &gt; Mistranslation.</li>
        <li>After annotating all identified issues in a sub-paragraph, use the
            <b>right arrow key</b> (or the <b>button</b>) to go to the next
            sub-paragraph.</li>

            You can modify or delete any rating in the current sub-paragraph
            by using the menu shown to the right of the rating. The menu is
            revealed when you hover your mouse over the hamburger icon
            (&#9776;). If deleted, the rating is shown with a strikethrough
            line. You can undelete a deleted rating using the menu, if desired.

            While editing a rating, its text will be shown with a

            to abort an ongoing modification to a rating.

          <li>
            To modify or delete a rating for a previous sentence in the

          <li>
            Sometimes, you might be re-evaluating a document that was already
            evaluated previously. In such cases, you will see the previous
            annotations and can simply keep them, edit them, delete them, or
            supplement them with additional annotations.

            Occasionally, the translated sentence will be altered to
            include an artificially injected error. Evaluating translation
            quality is a difficult and demanding task, and such "test sentences"
            are used to help you maintain the high level of attention the task
            needs. Once you have marked any error in a test sentence, its
            unaltered version will be shown. If you miss marking any error in a
            test sentence, you will be shown a cautionary reminder about that.
            In either case, once the unaltered version is revealed, you have to
            proceed to rate its quality just like all the other sentences.

    'Severities defined': `
      <h2>Severities defined</h2>
      <p>We define error/issue severity levels in this section.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Major severity</b>:
          Major severity errors significantly alter the meaning of the source
          text, or significantly degrade the quality of the text.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The translated text says something different from the intent of
              the source text, or is substantially difficult to understand, or
              has some very jarring linguistic flaw.
            </li>
            <li>
              Typically, accuracy and terminology errors fall here, as well as
              egregious style or grammar errors.
            </li>
            <li>
              The context of the document is sometimes the key in determining
              whether an error is major or minor. For example, changing the
              tense of a standalone sentence may be a minor error, but doing so
              in the middle of a narrative would be a major error.

          <b>Minor severity</b>:
          Minor severity errors are noticeable but minor flaws in the translated
          text. They do not significantly alter the meaning of the source text,
          and they do not significantly degrade the quality of the text.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Minor severity errors might add, drop, or modify minor details, or
              they may slightly decrease the stylistic quality of the text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Typically, the kinds of errors that fall under this severity level
              are grammar, spelling (including capitalization and whitespace),
              style, punctuation, locale convention, and creative
              reinterpretation.
            </li>
            <li>
              As mentioned earlier, the context of the document is sometimes the
              key in determining whether an error is major or minor.

                <b>Creative Reinterpretation</b>.
                The translated text <i>reinterprets the source, but preserves
                its intent</i>. Note that if the translation reinterprets the
                source text to such a great degree that it <i>changes</i> the
                intent, then it should be marked as using Mistranslation,
                Addition, or Omission subtypes, as appropriate.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Mark Creative Reinterpretation if the translation includes
                    additional text or omits some text that provides
                    explanations or context that may be obvious in the source
                    (target) locale, but not in the target (source) locale. For
                    example, an added short introduction of an entity not well
                    known in the target locale, or an omitted introduction of an
                    entity well known in the target locale.

                  <li>
                    The translation edits the source creatively, perhaps to make
                    the translated text more fluent or expressive or localized.
                    For example, a reordering of sentences or an addition of
                    text that is supported by the overall passage being
                    translated and does not change the intent of the source
                    text. Another example would be that of the name of an
                    exemplifying entity being changed to a better local
                    equivalent.

                <b>Mistranslation</b>.
                The translated text does not accurately represent the source
                text. Examples: (1) The source text talks about a person A
                knowing another person B, but the English translation says
                "A was intimate with B." (2) The source text states that
                something never happens, whereas the translation says it happens
                "often" or "rarely."
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Gender Mismatch</b>.
                Given the context, the gender is incorrect (incorrect pronouns,
                noun/adjective endings, etc). Misgendering errors typically have
                a major severity as they significantly alter the meaning of the
                source text. If the correct gender is not clear from the source
                context, assume the first instance of gender is correct and mark
                subsequent gender inconsistencies as errors. Examples: (1) "Mary
                slammed the door as he left." (2) Given the source text "My
                friend is an engineer. She is great at coding.", if its
                translation used a male form for the term "engineer", it would
                be incorrect, as we know the subject is female from the source
                context.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Source language fragment</b>.
                Content that should have been translated has been left
                untranslated. Example: A word, phrase or sentence in a German
                document has been copied verbatim into the English translation,
                but a natural translation is possible. Note that if only a short
                phrase or term is left untranslated, and that phrase or term
                is commonly used in the target language (for example, the French
                phrase "c'est la vie" used in English), then it's not an
                error (or is, at best, a minor error).
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Addition</b>.
                The translated text includes information not present in the
                source. Example: A translated sentence that includes adverbs or
                adjectives without equivalents in the original text, even after
                taking context into account.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Omission</b>.
                Content is missing from the translation that is present in the
                source. Example: A phrase has been dropped from the translation
                and it is not already implied by context. This error type needs
                to be annotated on the source side.

          <b>Fluency</b>.
          Issues related to the form or content of translated text, independent
          of its relation to the source text; errors in the translated text that
          make it harder to understand.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Inconsistency</b>.
                The text shows internal inconsistency (not related to
                terminology). Examples: (1) A person is referred to with a
                masculine pronoun in one sentence and a feminine pronoun in the
                next sentence. This would be a major error. (2) An entity is
                referred to as "Secretary of State" in one paragraph but as
                "Minister of State" in the next. This would be a minor error,
                unless the context is one where both "Minister of State" and
                "Secretary of State" are valid technical terms with different
                meanings, in which case it would be a major error.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Grammar</b>.
                Issues related to the grammar or syntax of the text, other than
                spelling and orthography. Example: An English text reads "They
                goes together," or "He could of fixed it." Both of these
                examples have jarring flaws that significantly degrade the
                fluency of the text and would justify a major severity. However,
                it's possible that these sentence constructs are present in a
                context where such colloquial usage would not be out of place,
                and in such contexts they may not be errors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Register</b>.
                The content uses the wrong grammatical register, such as using
                informal pronouns or verb forms when their formal counterparts
                are required. Example: A formal invitation uses the German
                informal pronoun "du" instead of "Sie." The annotator has to
                judge how egregious such a mistake is, in the context of the
                document, to decide the severity level of such an error. The use
                of an informal pronoun instead of a formal pronoun, in the
                context of a formal invitation may merit a major severity level,
                for example.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Spelling</b>.
                Issues related to spelling or capitalization of words, and
                whitespace. Example: The French word "mer" (sea) is used instead
                of the identically pronounced "maire" (mayor). This example
                would merit a major severity, as the meaning is substantially
                altered. Example: "Nobody in arizona expected snow." The word
                "Arizona" should start with an upper case letter, and this would
                be a minor error. Example: "Theyreached safely." This is a minor
                severity Spelling error because of the missing whitespace.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Text-Breaking</b>.
                Issues related to paragraph breaks and line breaks.
                If a sentence ends with an incorrect or missing paragraph break
                or line break, then mark the last part of it (word or
                punctuation) with this error type. Examples: (1) There should be
                a paragraph break but there is only a line break or there is not
                even a line break. (2) There should not be any break but a
                paragraph break is present in the middle of a sentence.
                <br><br>
                Certain paragraph breaks are very
                important for establishing the proper flow of the text: for
                example, before and after a section heading or a block-quote.
                If an important paragraph break is completely missing (there is
                not even a line break), then that is a major error, as it
                severely degrades the quality of the text. If an unwarranted
                paragraph break is seen in the middle of a sentence, that is
                also a major error. Most other errors of type
                "Fluency / Text-Breaking" are usually minor errors.

                Note that if sentences in the translated text are structured
                differently compared to the source (eg., a source sentence has
                been translated into two sentences, or two source sentences
                have been combined into a single translated sentence), that
                by itself is not a text-breaking error.

                <b>Punctuation</b>.
                Punctuation is used incorrectly (for the locale or style).
                Example: An English compound adjective appearing before a noun
                is not hyphenated, as in "dog friendly hotel." The reader can
                still grasp the intent quite easily in this case, so this
                example would have a minor severity.

              <li>
                <b>Character encoding</b>.
                Characters are garbled due to incorrect application of an

                for more. If such garbling is limited in scope and the overall
                text can still be understood, the severity level would be minor.

                <b>Unnatural or awkward</b>.
                The text is literal, written in an awkward style, unidiomatic or
                inappropriate in the context. Examples: (1) A sentence is
                translated literally, which copies a style that is not used in
                the target language. For example, “कौन कौन आया था?” in Hindi is
                translated into English as “Who who had come?” This would be a
                minor severity error. (2) A sentence is unnecessarily convoluted
                or too wordy, such as, "The lift traveled away from the ground
                floor." This would be a minor error. (3) Grammatically correct
                but slightly unnatural sounding sentences such as “From where
                did he come?” This would also be a minor error.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Bad sentence structure</b>.
                This error type is related to the arrangement of the sentence
                structure. The marked span of text is an unnecessary repetition,
                or it makes the sentence unnecessarily long, or it would have
                been better expressed as a clause in the previous sentence.
                Example (repetition): "Alexander had an idea. Alexander had a
                thought." This example would be a minor error, unless the
                context dictates otherwise. Example (long sentence): "The party,
                after blaming its losses on poor leadership, that the spokesman
                said could have paid more attention to the people's needs, split
                into two factions." This sentence could have been split into
                multiple sentences. Example (mergeable): "He gave him the money.
                He accepted the reward." These two sentences can be phrased
                better as a single sentence that makes it clearer who accepted
                the reward. This example is a minor error, without additional
                contextual information.

                <b>Archaic or obscure word choice</b>.
                The text contains archaic or obscure words that an average
                speaker of the target language may find hard to understand. This
                includes cases where obscure translations of terms are used,
                where instead transliterating or copying the source language
                would be more natural. (Archaic/formal terms may be okay in
                certain contexts such as government or historical documents,
                academic papers, etc.) Examples: (1) "He was transparently evil"
                gets translated to "वह पारदर्शी रूप से दुष्ट था।" in Hindi which uses an
                obscure term for "transparently" instead of the more common
                "स्पष्ट". (2) The term "computer" is translated into Hindi as
                "संगणक" (saṅgaṇaka) but the transliterated version "कंप्यूटर"
                (kampyootar) is much more common and easily understood. (3) In
                the sentence "Last night we went to a bar and drank a homerkin
                of beer", the term 'homerkin' (meaning 'several gallons') is
                unnecessarily obscure. It would be much more colloquial to say
                'we drank a ton of beer', or similar.

                Translation does not adhere to appropriate or contains
                terminology that does not fit the context. Example: "acide
                sulfurique" is translated to "acid of sulfur" instead of
                "sulfuric acid." This example would have a minor severity level.

              <li>
                <b>Inconsistent</b>.
                Terminology is used in an inconsistent manner within the text.
                Example: The translation of a phone manual alternates between
                the terms "front camera" and "front lens." This example would

                Content uses the wrong format for addresses. A part of the
                address was translated that should be kept in English. Examples:
                "1600 Pennsylvania Ave" is translated to Russian as
                "1600 Пенсильвания авеню" instead of "Пенсильвания авеню 1600."
                This example would have a minor severity level.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Date format</b>.
                A text uses a date format inappropriate for its locale. Example:
                The date "1969年1月6日" is shown as "6/1/1969" (instead of
                "1/6/1969") and the target locale can be clearly inferred to be
                U.S. English. For this example, the severity level would be
                major as the meaning of the date has been significantly altered.

              <li>
                <b>Currency format</b>.
                Content uses the wrong format for currency. Example: The dollar
                symbol is used as a suffix, as in "100$." This example would
                have a minor severity level.

              <li>
                <b>Telephone format</b>.

                "(xxx) xnn-nnnn". This example would have a minor severity

              <li>
                <b>Time format</b>.
                Content uses the wrong form for time. Example: Time is shown as
                "11.0" instead of "11:00" in a language where the former is a
                mistake. This example would have a minor severity level.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Name format</b>.
                Content uses the wrong form for name. Example: The Chinese name
                (which lists surname first) "马琳" is translated as "Lin Ma"
                instead of "Ma Lin". This example would also have a minor
                severity level as it the reader can make out the true intent

              1. Wujue, or Jueju, is a genre of poetry. The source means that
                Wang Wei and Meng Haoran were better at Wujue, and Wang
                Changling and others wrote Qijue very well.
              <br>
              2. The highlighted "other" should be "others".
              <br>
              3. Same as 1.
              <br>
              4. The text "is the only person who" contains a repetition of the
                word "only" which is already present at the beginning of the
                sentence.
              <br>
              5. Li Bai is the only one who was good at both. The translation
                considers Wujue and Qijue as persons instead of poetry genres.
              <br>
              6. The original text means the poet wrote both genres incredibly
                well. The translated text "is at the same level" missed the
                information that the poet is very good at the genres.</td>

          Please follow the general stylistic guidelines for your target
          language and mark an error for any part of any sentence that does not
          comply with them. Below is a reminder of what you should be looking
          for. Please note that we expect you to perform basic online research
          to verify the translation of company and organization names, brand
          names, acronyms, titles of documents and cultural works whenever you
          are unsure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that most of the time, stylistic errors have minor severity
          (unless they alter the meaning, or make the translation really hard to
          understand—e.g., change in number values, or meaning-altering
          punctuation marks).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Acronyms</b>:Acronyms should be translated (with an equivalent
              acronym in the target language or a spelled out translated
              version) where the translated version is more common than the
              source language version. Conversely, if the untranslated version
              is more common, a translated version has not been established or
              the abbreviation or acronym constitutes a registered name or
              trademark, the abbreviation or acronym should be kept in the
              source language.</li>
          <li><b>Books, movies, songs, games, research papers, academic journal
              titles, legal or official documents (foreign acts and regulations,
              international agreements, treaties, conventions, resolutions)</b>:
              Where an official translation exists, it should be used. Where no
              official translation is available, the title should be kept in the
              source language or an appropriate translation should be provided,
              based on what is accepted/most common in the particular case.</li>
          <li><b>Capitalization</b>: Product names, titles, and proper nouns
              should be capitalized even if they are not capitalized in the
              source. Titles should use sentence case or title case, based on
              what is used in your target locale. Title case is used mainly in
              English.
          </li>
          <li><b>Company names, brands, and institutions</b>: Company names and
              brand names should not be localized/translated. Names of
              institutions and organizations can be translated if appropriate in
              the target language.</li>
          <li><b>Currency</b>: Make sure currency acronyms and symbols are
              correctly localized and incorporated into the sentence.</li>
          <li><b>Dates</b>: Make sure the correct date format is used as per
              your target locale.</li>
          <li><b>Explanations</b>: There should be no added explanations. Do not
              expect this and do not log an error if an explanation in brackets
              is not provided.</li>
          <li><b>Measurements</b>: Do not expect measurements to be converted
              between imperial and metric. They will most likely be just
              translated. Do not log errors as long as the measurement units are
              correctly translated.</li>
          <li><b>Numbers</b>: Make sure the correct decimal and thousands
              separators are used</li>
          <li><b>Time</b>: Make sure time is correctly indicated in the format
              that is acceptable in your target locale in the context of the
              sentence (24-hour clock vs. 12-hour clock)</li>
