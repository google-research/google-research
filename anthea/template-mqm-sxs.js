  instructions_section_contents: {
    'Navigation': `
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>
      Each task consists of text from a single document alongside <b>two</b>
      translations of it. Sometimes it can be a very short document (even a single
      sentence), but typically a document will have 10-20 sentences.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      You will go through a document in convenient steps of small
      "sub-paragraphs" (groups of consecutive sentences from the same
      paragraph). You can move from one sub-paragraph to the next (and back)
      using the arrow keys or using the buttons labeled with left and right
      arrows. Note that these sub-paragraphs are automatically created in the
      source and the translations, <i>independently</i> of each
      other, purely for convenient navigation through potentially long
      documents. In particular, they are <i>not</i> expected to be
      aligned—i.e., the translation of the third (say) sub-paragraph in the
      source needs not be exactly just the third sub-paragraph in a
      translation.
      </li>
      <li>
      If the document was translated in steps of segments that were smaller
      than the whole document, then at the end of the last sub-paragraph in
      the source of each segment, the right arrow key/button will take
      you to the start (i.e., the first sub-paragraph) of the first translation
      of that segment. In the same way, it will take you to the start of the
      second translation of that segment. At the end of the second translation
      of that segment, it will take you back to the source but of the next segment.
      </li>
      <li>
      If the entire document was translated as one segment, then the right
      arrow key/button will take you to the start of the translation only at
      the end of the source of the whole document.
      </li>
      <li>
      If a source segment appears to be too long, you can (at any time) choose
      to jump to the translations after reading some part of the source using
      the Tab key. The Tab key will take you to different columns from left
      to right (source &#rarr; translation 1 &#rarr; translation 2 &#rarr; source),
      and then back to the source. We leave the judgment to you, as to how to
      divide your annotation process for long segments into smaller units.
      </li>
      <li>
      You can also use the left arrow key/button to go <i>back</i> through the
      sub-paragraphs and segments. You can also directly click on any
      previously read part of the text to jump back to it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    `,
    'Annotation Process': `
    <h2>Annotation Process</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Review the translations of each segment against the source, following
          the general guidelines above.</li>
      <li>
        Select the <b>span</b> of words affected by the issue by clicking on
        the word/particle where the identified issue “begins”, then clicking
        on the word/particle where the issue “ends”. If it is only one word,
        then you have to click on it twice.
        <ul>
          <li>The marked span should be the minimal contiguous sequence such
              that modifying the word(s) within the span, deleting the span,
              or moving the word(s) somewhere else in the sentence will remove
              the identified issue. The span should not include adjoining
              words that are not directly affected by the identified issue and
              do not need to be modified in order for the issue to be
              fixed.</li>
          <li>You can only mark spans within sentences. In the rare case that
              an error straddles multiple sentences (e.g., when there is an
              incorrect sentence break), just mark the first part of the span
              that lies within a sentence.</li>
          <li>The shorter the span, the more useful it is.</li>
          <li>When it comes to "Style/Unnatural or awkward" errors, please
              pinpoint the error rather than extend the span to an entire
              clause.</li>
          <li>If a single issue affects words that do not directly follow each
              other, as is the case with split verbs in German
              (“teilte die Feuerwehr auf”) or phrasal verbs in English
              (“called Mary and her brother up”), log the issue only for the
              first part (“teilte”, “called”) and do not log anything for the
              latter part (“auf”, “up”). The text between “teilte” and “auf”,
              or between “called” and “up”, should not be included in the span
              if the issue is with the verb only (“aufteilen”, “call up”).
          </li>
          <li>If the same error is present in both translations, please make
              sure to mark the error in both translations.
          </li>
          <li>Note: issues can appear either in the translations, or
              rarely, for the "Source issue" type, in the source. When
              the error is an omission, the error span must be selected in the
              source.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Select the <b>severity</b> of the issue using the buttons in the
        rightmost column ("Evaluations") or their keyboard shortcuts:
        <ul>
          <li>Major severity (M)</li>
          <li>Minor severity (m)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Select the <b>category</b> (also called <b>type</b>) and
          <b>subcategory</b> (also called <b>subtype</b>) of the error/issue
          found. For example: Accuracy &gt; Mistranslation.</li>
      <li>After annotating all identified issues in a sub-paragraph, use the
          <b>right arrow key</b> (or the <b>button</b>) to go to the next
          sub-paragraph.</li>
    </ol>`,
    'Annotation Tips': `
    <details>
      <summary>
        <span class="summary-heading">Annotation Tips</span>
      </summary>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You can modify or delete any rating in the current sub-paragraph
          by using the menu shown to the right of the rating. The menu is
          revealed when you hover your mouse over the hamburger icon
          (&#9776;). If deleted, the rating is shown with a strikethrough
          line. You can undelete a deleted rating using the menu, if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
          While editing a rating, its text will be shown with a
          <span style="text-decoration: red wavy underline">red wavy
          underline</span>.
          You can use the "Cancel" button or the Escape key to abort an ongoing
          modification to a rating.
        </li>
        <li>
          To modify or delete a rating for a previous sentence in the
          current document, you can first click on it to navigate to it (or
          use the arrow key/button) and then use the hamburger menu.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes, you might be re-evaluating a document that was already
          evaluated previously. In such cases, you will see the previous
          annotations and can simply keep them, edit them, delete them, or
          supplement them with additional annotations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Occasionally, the translated sentence will be altered to
          include an artificially injected error. Evaluating translation
          quality is a difficult and demanding task, and such "test sentences"
          are used to help you maintain the high level of attention the task
          needs. Once you have marked any error in a test sentence, its
          unaltered version will be shown. If you miss marking any error in a
          test sentence, you will be shown a cautionary reminder about that.
          In either case, once the unaltered version is revealed, you have to
          proceed to rate its quality just like all the other sentences.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </details>`,
