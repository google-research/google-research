      <h2>Navigation</h2>
      <p>
        Each task consists of multiple translations of the same single source
        document. Sometimes it can be a very short document (even a single
        sentence), but typically a document will have 5-10 sentences. Each
        translation of the document is presented separately.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        You will go through a document in convenient steps of small
        "sub-paragraphs" (groups of consecutive sentences from the same
        paragraph). You can move from one sub-paragraph to the next (and back)
        using the arrow keys or using the buttons labeled with left and right
        arrows. Note that these sub-paragraphs are automatically created on the
        source side and the translation side, <i>independently</i> of each
        other, purely for convenient navigation through potentially long
        documents. In particular, they are <i>not</i> expected to be
        aligned—i.e., the translation of the third (say) sub-paragraph on the
        source side need not be exactly just the third sub-paragraph on the
        translation side.
        </li>
        <li>
        If the document was translated in steps of segments that were smaller
        than the whole document, then at the end of the last sub-paragraph on
        the source side of each segment, the right arrow key/button will take
        you to the start (i.e., the first sub-paragraph) of the translation of
        that segment. And, at the end of the translation side of that segment,
        it will take you to the start of the source side of the next segment.
        </li>
        <li>
        If the entire document was translated as one segment, then the right
        arrow key/button will take you to the start of the translation only at
        the end of the source side of the whole document.
        </li>
        <li>
        If a source segment appears to be too long, you can (at any time) choose
        to jump to the translation side after reading some part of the source,
        using the Tab key. The Tab key will similarly allow you to jump back to
        the source side from the translation side. We leave the judgment to you,
        as to how to divide your annotation process for long segments into
        smaller units.
        </li>
        <li>
        You can also use the left arrow key/button to go <i>back</i> through the
        sub-paragraphs and segments. You can also directly click on any
        previously read part of the text to jump back to it.
        </li>
        <li>
        When you are done annotating one translation, click the
        "Next Translation" button to move to the next translation. You can use
        "Prev Translation" to go back. If "Next Translation" is not visible,
        then you have reached the final translation.
        </li>
        <li>
        Note that the source is the same for all translations, but source-side
        ratings are not currently shared between translations. Please mark any
        source-side errors in each translation.
        </li>
      </ul>
