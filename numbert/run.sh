echo "The Charnel House (Le Charnier) is a c.1944–1948 painting by Spanish \
artist Pablo Picasso (1881–1973), purportedly dealing with the Nazi genocide \
of the Holocaust.
The black and white 'grisaille' composition centres on a massed pile of \
corpses, and was based primarily upon film and photographs of a slaughtered \
family during the Spanish Civil War.
It is considered to be Picasso's second major anti-war painting, the first \
being the monumental Guernica (1937), but it is not thought to be as \
significant as that work because the art \
ist left it unfinished." > numbert/example.txt
