r"""Maps latent space to coordinates to pixel space.

This module will provide two primary sets of functions. One set of functions
will translate latent coordinates into the xy-coordinates of a curve, scaled so
the entire curve falls within [0, 1] \times [0, 1]. The other will translate a
list of points (xy-coordinates) into pixel intensity matrices. The
transformations are continuous and piecewise differentiable.
