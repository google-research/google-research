"""Baseline mechanisms for (differentially private) top-k selection.

This file implements a non-private, exact top-k mechanism, the peeling mechanism

the Laplace top-k mechanism (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08233), and the infinity
norm mechanism (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.06095.pdf, see Theorem 4.1.).

  The tightest known privacy analysis of the peeling mechanism uses concentrated
  differential privacy (CDP). It combines the exponential mechanism's specific
  CDP guarantee with the generic conversion from CDP to approximate DP.

  In more detail, an eps'-DP exponential mechanism is eps'^2/8-CDP
  (Lemmas 3.2 and 3.4 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07223, or more
  explicitly in Corollary 7 of
  https://differentialprivacy.org/exponential-mechanism-bounded-range/), so k
  applications are k * eps'^2/8-CDP (Lemma 1.7 in BS16,
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065). By Proposition 1.3 in BS16, this is
  (k * eps'^2/8 + eps' * sqrt(k log(1/delta)/2}, delta)-DP for any delta > 0.
  Setting the first term equal to eps, we get
  k * eps'^2/8 + eps' * sqrt(k log(1/delta)/2} - eps = 0.
  Substitute y = eps' * sqrt{k} to get
  (1/8) * y^2 + sqrt{log(1/delta)/2} * y - eps = 0. Then by the quadratic
  formula, eps' * sqrt{k} = y
  = -sqrt{log(1/delta) / 2} + sqrt{log(1/delta) / 2 + eps / 2} / (1/4). Divide
  by sqrt{k} and rearrange to get
  eps' = sqrt{(8 log(1/delta) + 8eps) / k} - sqrt{8 log(1/delta) / k}.
