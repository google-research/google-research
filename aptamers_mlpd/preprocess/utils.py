  A Read is one record from a FASTQ file and represents one read off a
  sequencer. All the values are strings. The record contains:

  (1) the title of the read (unique identifier),
  (2) any auxiliary information from the title line (e.g., barcode info)
  (3) the DNA sequence as recorded by the sequencer, and
  (4) the per-base quality of the sequencing.

  The per-base quality is a string of the same length as the DNA sequence,
  which can be converted to an integer based on the ascii + an offset.
  The numbers are generally between 0 and 40 and the exact encoding and
  offset depends on the version of the sequencer.
