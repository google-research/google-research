  Args:
    sequence: String DNA sequence of the aptamer selected.
    source_enum: Enumeration indicating how the aptamer was generated,
      for example, SOURCE_INVENTED or SOURNCE_IN_TEST.
    control_enum: Enumeration indicating whether this aptamer was picked as
      a control sequence, for example, NOT_CONTROL or POSITIVE_CONTROL.
    cluster_num: Integer of the id of the cluster that this sequence was in.
      Only used for sequences in the test and validation sets.
    mutation_step: Integer. The step number for mutations.
    seed_sequence: String sequence of the seed if applicable.
    model_score: Float value given by the model for this sequence.
    mutation_type: Enumeration indicating how the mutated sequence was created.
