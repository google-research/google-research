  We model affinity by adding up many random or deterministic contributions to
  the binding free energy $\delta G$, which is related to the equilibrium
  dissociation constant $k_d$ by:

    \delta G = k_B T ln(k_d)

  where $k_B$ is Boltmann's constant and $T$ is the temperature (Eq (20) in
  the reference below). This results in roughly log-normal distributions for
  the dissociation constants (binding affinities).

      generated sequence.
