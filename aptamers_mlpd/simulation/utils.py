  """Yield an infinite stream of numbers for seeding random number generators.

  This method is not proven to be cryptographically secure, and only explores a
  small portion of the state space for NumPy's random number generator. Still,
  it's a useful shortcut for writing decoupled functions that rely on random
  state. See this thread for extensive discussion of its merits and the
  alternatives:
  https://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2016-May/075487.html

  Example:

    >>> seed_gen = random_seed_stream(42)
    >>> next(seed_gen)
    1608637542

  Args:
    random_seed: optional integer used to seed this stream of random seeds.

  Yields:
    Integer seeds suitable for use in numpy.random.RandomState. Each seed is
    independent and psuedo-randomly generated from the `random_seed` argument.
