  It is generically assumed that an agent will only take userId as input, since

  to make use of user embeddings will need to have those provided, and use them

    in that slate.  In our simulation, we want to recommend a single item, but
    still allow for users to choose a different movie from the universe of
    possible options.

    To implement this, all agents should return the full set of movies as the
    slate, which should always have the same elements: The first position in the
    slate corresponds to the "recommendation", and is treated as such by the
    user choice model, while the order of the remaining elements is ignored.
