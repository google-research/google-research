// To optimize this objective we use local search. We start with each vertex in
// its own cluster. We consider moves of the following form: move all vertices
// in a "move set" S of vertices to either one of the existing clusters or to a
// newly created cluster. We currently consider the following options for S:
//  - Each vertex in a singleton move set. This reduces to the classic single
//    vertex moves.
//  - One move set per current cluster with all the vertices currently in it.
//    With these move sets we're effectively considering merging two clusters.
// The local search proceeds with effectively three nested loops. The outermost
// loop is over the num_iterations iterations. The middle loop is over the four
// move types listed above. The inner loop is over move sets of the particular
// type. For each move set considered we move that move set to the cluster that
// improves the objective the most if an improving move exists.
