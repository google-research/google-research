The provided code replicates the synthetic data experiments described in the paper.

The library may be installed as a python package with all its dependencies by executing `pip install .` from the top-level directory.

To replicate the synthetic data experiment, first generate synthetic data and write to a file by executing `colab/synthetic_data_to_file.ipynb`.

Then, execute the following in any order:

  * Evaluate the discrete eigendecomposition approach to reproduce Table 1: `colab/discrete_eigen.ipynb`
  * Train and evaluate models to replicate Table 2: `colab/lsa_synthetic_10seeds.ipynb`
  * Sweep over the strength of the distribution shift and create figure for the WAE method: `colab/synthetic_sweep_experiment.ipynb`
  * Sweep over the strength of the distribution shift and create figure for the continuous spectral method: `colab/continuous_spectrail_method.ipynb`
