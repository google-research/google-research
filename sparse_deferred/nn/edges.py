"""Offers functions to map features from nodes to edges and vice versa.

Example, to develop standard graph network layer, where:
 - Each edge feature is the concatenation of
   (its feature, source node features, target_node_features)
   --> fed into one FullyConnected layer.
 - Then each node sets its features to:
   FullyConnected(NodeFeatures, AvgSourceEdgeFeatures, AvgTargetEdgeFeatures)
   where "AvgSourceEdgeFeatures" is the average of all edge features from
   edges that have this node as a source.
   "AvgTargetEdgeFeatures" is the average of all edge features from
   edges that have this node as a target.

then, you can write the code:

```py
graph: graph_struct.GraphStruct = ...
engine = sdnp.engine   # (or of JAX, or of tf).

# Assume `graph` has node-set 'n' and edge-set 'e'.

# Edge features reads from nodes.
edge_features = map_nodes_to_incident_edges(
    engine, graph, 'e', edge_layer=concat_features)

# Map through fully-connected layer. (dense_layer_fn : Tensor -> Tensor).
edge_features = dense_layer_fn(edge_features)

# Node reads from edges.
node_features = combine_node_features(
    engine, graph, 'n', [('e', edge_features)], node_layer=concat_features)

# Map through another fully-connected layer.
node_features = dense_layer_fn_2(node_features)

# You can re-insert the node features into the graph.
graph = graph.update(nodes={'n': {'f': node_features}})
```
