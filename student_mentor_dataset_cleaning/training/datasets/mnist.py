  The dataset will have three splits: student training, student validation and

    student_train_portion: The fraction of the dataset used for student
      training.
    student_validation_portion: The fraction of the dataset used for student
      validation.
    mentor_portion: The fraction of the dataset used for mentor training.
    noise_rate: Fraction of the data points whose labels will be randomized.
    target_distribution_parameter: Parameter controlling the steepness of the
      exponential distribution used for resamling the training split.
