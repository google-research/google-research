  Args:
    img_file: string - Filepath of image to load.
    patch_height: int - Height of the desired patches.
    patch_width: int - Width of the desired patches.
    patch_overlap: int - Overlap between patches.
    patch_dir: Text - Output directory to save the generated patches.
    patch_base: Text - Common name (identifier) to save the patches.
    patch_annotation: Optional[Text] - Common post-fix of the patch name.
    patch_ext: Optional[Text] (default: png) - Extension of patches.
    load_cv2: use cv2 to load image files or utils.load_image.

  This function creates overlapping patches, eg for an input image with a
  width of 1500, using patch_width 800 and patch_overlap 200:
  [0-800, 600-1400, 700-1500]

  Note 1/: If a patch exceeds image boundary, it is repositioned to
    [image-length - patch-length, image-length].
    Image-length could be either width or height. This could create two almost
    overlapping images! For example, consider the worst-case when:
    image-width = patch-width + 1
    Then two patches with just a single pixel difference will be created.
    Negative values can not be obtained, because we require image size to be
    larger or equal to patch size.
  Note 2/: Patch naming is (loosely) as follows:
    {patch_dir}/{patch_base}_{patch_name}_{patch_annotation}{patch_ext}
