  """Approximately mines the top k highest scoreing negatives with indices.

  This function groups the negative scores into num_negatives / k groupings and
  returns the highest scoring element from each group. It also returns the index

  Args:
    negative_scores: A matrix with the scores of the negative elements.
    k: The number of negatives to mine.

  Returns:
    The tuple (top_k_scores, top_k_indices), where top_k_indices describes the
