"""Wrapper to enable rendering grids with custom colorization.

This is meant to be used on top of `TabularWrapper`. The user can pass in a
vector of length `num_states` and a matplotlib ColorMap. The grid cells that
correspond to states will be "colored" with the specified value and palette.

    """Modifies the 'image' from an observation with custom values and cmap.

    For each valid state, it will lookup that state's value, normalize it with
    respect to `boundary_values` (to obtain a value in [0, 1]), and lookup the
    color in the supplied `cmap`. For values outside of `boundary_values`, it
    will use `boundary_colors[0]` or `boundary_colors[1]` if it is lower or
    higher than the boundary values, respectively.
    If any of the `boundary_values` is None, it will use the minimum/maximum
    value in `values` as a normalizing factor.

    Args:
      obs: A MiniGrid observation.
      values: list, must have length equal to self.num_states.
      cmap: Matplotlib color map, used to fetch colors from normalized values.
      boundary_values: pair of floats, boundary values to use for cmap color
        selection. If either is `None`, will obtain value from `values`.
      boundary_colors: pair of colors, to use for lower/upper extremes.

    Returns:
      A gym.spaces.Box object with valid states colored according to `values`
      and `cmap`. This can be fed directly to `plt.imshow()` for rendering.
