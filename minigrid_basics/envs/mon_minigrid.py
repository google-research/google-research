"""Class to make it easier to specify MiniGrid environments.

This class will read a .grid file that specifies the grid environment and
dynamics. It offers the option of specifying MDPs with four directional actions
instead of rotate/fwd.

Gym-MiniGrid is built on the assumption that the agent is always facing a
specific direction. Thus, the design decision was to always rotate the agent
towards the direction it wants to go and then try to go. As such, the arrow is
always changing its direction. It doesn't matter in the tabular case. In the
setting in which one looks at the raw pixels, the agent direction encodes its
previous action. This might be something to keep in mind.

Moreover, we decided to not allow other actions such as pick up object or
toggle.  This setting should be the standard one. If one wants to add objects,
we might need to do something more here, like automatically activate 'pick up
object' if the agent ends up at the same tile as the object.

The constructor parameter `stochasticity` controls the amount of probability
mass distributed to transitioning to any of the other neighbouring states
(including staying in the current state).
