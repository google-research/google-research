class SDT(nn.Module):
  """Fast implementation of soft decision tree in PyTorch.

     Adapted from https://github.com/xuyxu/Soft-Decision-Tree

    Args:
      input_dim : int
        The number of input dimensions.
      output_dim : int
        The number of output dimensions. For example, for a multi-class
        classification problem with `K` classes, it is set to `K`.
      depth : int, default=5
        The depth of the soft decision tree. Since the soft decision tree is
        a full binary tree, setting `depth` to a large value will drastically
        increases the training and evaluating cost.
      lambda_coeff : float, default=1e-3
        The coefficient of the regularization term in the training loss. Please
        refer to the paper on the formulation of the regularization term.
      use_cuda : bool, default=False
        When set to `True`, use GPU to fit the model. Training a soft decision
        tree using CPU could be faster considering the inherent data forwarding
        process.
    other Attributes:
      internal_node_num_ : int
        The number of internal nodes in the tree. Given the tree depth `d`, it
        equals to :math:`2^d - 1`.
      leaf_node_num_ : int The number of leaf nodes in the tree. Given the tree
        depth `d`, it equals to :math:`2^d`.
      penalty_list : list
        A list storing the layer-wise coefficients of the regularization term.
      inner_nodes : torch.nn.Sequential
        A container that simulates all internal nodes in the soft decision tree.
        The sigmoid activation function is concatenated to simulate the
        probabilistic routing mechanism.
      leaf_nodes : torch.nn.Linear
        A `nn.Linear` module that simulates all leaf nodes in the tree.
