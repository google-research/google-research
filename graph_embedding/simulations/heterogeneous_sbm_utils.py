  """Given a list of # clusters per-type, compute cross-type cluster components.

  This function expands num_clusters_lists into a list of cluster index lists --
  one list of size num_clusters_list[i] for each i-th entry. It then assigns
  each member of each list to a unique component out of min(num_clusters_list)
  components.

  For example, an input [3, 4, 2] implies three clusters for type-1 nodes, four
  clusters for type-2 nodes, and two clusters for type-1 nodes. This function
  will return two type components, and evenly (or as-evenly-as-possible) divide
  the cluster indices of each type among the two components. See the test file
  for the expected outputs from this example.

  Arguments:
    num_clusters_list: list of the number of clusters for each node type.
  Returns:
    output: a 2-tuple with the following elements:
      cluster_index_lists: a list of cluster index lists.
      type_components: a list of cluster index sets, giving the type components.
