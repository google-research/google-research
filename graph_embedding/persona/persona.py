r"""Implementation of the Ego-splitting Clustering Framework.

===============================

This is part of the implementation accompanying the WWW 2019 paper, [_Is a
Single Embedding Enough? Learning Node Representations that Capture Multiple
Social Contexts_](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub46238).

The code in this file allows to create persona graphs, and to obtain overlapping
clusters using the persona graph method defined in the KDD 2017 paper
[_Ego-splitting Framework: from Non-Overlapping to Overlapping
Clusters_](http://epasto.org/papers/kdd2017.pdf).

Citing
------
If you find _Persona Embedding_ useful in your research, we ask that you cite
the following paper:
> Epasto, A., Perozzi, B., (2019).
> Is a Single Embedding Enough? Learning Node Representations that Capture
Multiple Social Contexts.
> In _The Web Conference_.

Example execution
------
python3 -m graph_embedding.persona.persona
  --input_graph=${graph} \
  --output_clustering=${clustering_output}

Where ${graph} is the path to a text file containing the graph and
${clustering_output} is the path to the output clustering.

The graph input format is a text file containing one edge per row represented
as its pair of node ids. The graph is supposed to be undirected.
For instance the file:
1 2
2 3
represents the triangle 1, 2, 3.

The output clustering format is a text file containing for each row one
(overlapping) cluster represented as the space-separted list of node ids in the
cluster.

The code uses two clustering algorithms local_clustering_method and
global_clustering_method respectively in each egonet and to split the persona ]
graph. The follow three options are allowed at the moment:
connected_components: the standard connected component algorithm.
label_prop: a label propagation based algorithm
            (nx.label_prop.label_propagation_communities).
modularity: an algorithm optimizing modularity
            (nx.modularity.greedy_modularity_communities).
