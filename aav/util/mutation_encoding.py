"""Utilities for encoding sequence mutations as feature vectors.

A mutation mask is a relative sequence, given some reference base sequence.
Within a mutation mask or sequence, tokens (all single characters currently)
have the following meaning:
  "_": wild type (non-mutated) position
  "<upper case letter>": single residue substitution
  "<lower case letter>": single residue insertion

For example, given the 4-residue WT sequence, "TEST", then a single point
substitution can be encoded as a mutation mask: "A___", "_A__", "__A_", or
"___A" depending on the location of the substitution within the WT seq.

Additionally, a single prefix insertion is allowed; all other insertions occur
following the WT residue position. For example, an alanine prefix insertion
for the "TEST" (WT) sequence would be encoded as "aTEST" while a suffix
insertion of alanine would be encoded as "TESTa".
