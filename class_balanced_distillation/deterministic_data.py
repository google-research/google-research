r"""Helper functions for building deterministic tf.data input pipelines.

The function `create_dataset()` makes it easy to build a `tf.data` based input
pipeline that allows for completely reproducible results based on a single
initial random seed. The caller must take care to create a unique initial seed
on every host that is then passed to `create_dataset()`, where further unique
random keys are derived for every batch. Within a single batch, this key is
exposed as the special feature "rng" and can be used to implement stateless
preprocessing functions.

The function `get_read_instruction_for_host()` makes it easy to split a dataset
evenly between multiple hosts in a SPMD setup with multiple machines. Within a
single host, every batch is usually distributed to all the attached accelerators
(the first value of the `batch_dims` argument to `create_dataset()`).

The function `create_distributed_dataset()` finally is intended to be used in
conjunction with a `tf.distribute.Strategy`.

Synopsis for deterministic training with multiple hosts:

  rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)  # Global RNG (e.g. from config)
  rng = jax.random.fold_in(rng, jax.host_id())  # Derive RNG for this host.
  dataset_builder = tfds.builder(...)
  split = deterministic_data.get_read_instruction_for_host(
      "train", dataset_builder.info.splits["train"].num_examples)
  ds = deterministic_data.create_dataset(
      dataset_builder,

  )
  ds_iter = iter(ds)
  for _ in range(num_train_steps):
