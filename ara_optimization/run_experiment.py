  Args:
    train_df: dataset that is analyzed for setting hyperparameters
    eval_df: separate dataset on which error is reported
    slice_columns: columns specifying the groups to aggregate over
    value_columns: columns specifying the queries to estimate for each group
    count_column: a column that counts the number of input records
    error_metric: the error metric for each value column and the count column
    privacy_budgets: a list of overall privacy budgets for evaluation
    baseline_quantiles: the quantiles to use for baseline clipping thresholds

  Returns:
    A dictionary storing the error of the optimized algorithm and each baseline
    for each total privacy budget. The keys of the dictionary are strings such
    as 'Optimization', '95' or '99' (where the second and third keys correspond
    to baselines), and the values are lists consisting of the error achieved by
    that algorithm for each privacy budget.
