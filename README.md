# Subclass distillation demo
This is a fork of Google Research [repo](https://github.com/google-research/google-research) keeping only the `subclass_distillation` folder.

This is the minimal/demo implementation of:

MÃ¼ller, R., Kornblith, S., & Hinton, G. (2020).
[Subclass distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03936). arXiv preprint
arXiv:2002.03936.

The idea is to jointly classify and learn subclasses (clusters per class). An auxiliary loss is used to load balance the use of each subclass. These subclasses logits are then used as teacher targets to train a smaller student.
