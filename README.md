Because the repo is large, we recommend you download only the subdirectory of
interest:

```
SUBDIR=foo
svn export https://github.com/google-research/google-research/trunk/$SUBDIR
```

If you'd like to submit a pull request, you'll need to clone the repository;
we recommend making a shallow clone (without history).

```
git clone git@github.com:google-research/google-research.git --depth=1
```
