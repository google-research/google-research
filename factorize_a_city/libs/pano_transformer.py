"""Library that defines a panoramic transformer which rotates the world.

The panoramic transformer performs a yaw rotation about the camera's z-axis
by translating an equirectangular representation. We assume a camera convention
of z-axis up.

Below is a top-down view of the camera coordinate system. The +z-axis points
into this viewpoint. A positive yaw rotation corresponds to a CCW rotation about
the z-axis when looking down.

    +-----> x

One thing to note is that a CCW rotation of the camera is equivalent to a
CW rotation of the scene. Therefore rotating the scene by an offset phi
is equivalent to rotating the camera by -phi.

Usage:
  pano_image = ... # a pano or a representation derived from a pano
  phi = ...        # a differentiable estimate of a yaw rotation that is
                   # predicted from pano_image. Units in radians.

  # Rotating the scene by phi is equivalent to rotating the camera by -phi.
  rotation_normalized_pano_image = shift_pano_by_rotation(pano_image, -phi)
  rotation_normalized_output = network(rotation_normalized_pano_image)

  # Optional inverse rotate to get restore pano_image's original orientation.
  output = shift_pano_by_rotation(rotation_normalized_output, alpha_phi)

def rotate_pano_horizontally(input_feature_map, yaw_angle):
  """Rotates input_feature_map by yaw_angle by horizontally translating pixels.

  The layer is differentiable with respect to yaw_angle and  input_feature_map.
  yaw_angle is positive for CCW rotation about the z-axis where the coordinates
  are constructed with z-axis facing up.

  Args:
    input_feature_map: panoramic image or neural feature maps of shape [B, H, W,
      C].
    yaw_angle: A tensor of shape `[B]` which represents the desired rotation of
      input_feature_map. yaw_angle is in units of radians. A positive yaw_angle
      rolls pixels left.

  Returns:
    A rotated feature map with dimensions `[B, H, W, C]`
