## Available Features

With this notebook you will be able to:

* Compute the NNGP validation accuracy of a NAS-Bench-101 model on (a subset of) CIFAR-10.
* Compute metrics introduced in the paper to evaluate the quality of performance predictors including:
  * Kendall's Tau
  * Correlation Coefficient
  * Prediction Quality for Exceedance of Threshold Performance (PQETP)
  * Discovered Performance
