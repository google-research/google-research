# Example of training just the classification head, using a pretrained encoder
# and projection head (the projection head is only relevant for measuring
# contrastive loss). This script expects an argument which is a path to the
# train directory of a previously trained model, which was launched using the
# simclr_imagenet_resnet50.sh script. If your previously trained model used a
# different configuration, then flags in this file will likely have to be
# updated so that it will restore correctly.
