"""Common type annotations for DEDAL data preprocessing pipelines."""

from typing import Dict, Iterable, List, MutableMapping, Tuple, Union

# The data preprocessing pipelines for DEDAL operate for the most part on
# tabular data, with the caveat that values may be scalar or variable-length.
# Only `bool`, `int`, `float` and `str` types are supported as base types so
# far. Variable-length values are internally represented as Python `list`s, but
# should be thought of as `Collection`s, since their order is not guaranteed to
# be deterministic.
SingleValue = Union[bool, int, float, str]
Value = Union[SingleValue, List[SingleValue]]
# Table rows are represented as key-value pairs with the column names serving as
# the keys.
Record = MutableMapping[str, Value]

# Often, a specific `str`-valued field of a `Record` may be designed to serve as
# the `Record`'s key for a Beam pipeline.
Key = str
KeyRecordPair = Tuple[Key, Record]

# After a `CoGroupByKey`, `Record`s from different (named) `PCollection`s having
# the same `Key` get grouped as a `dict` of `PCollection` names to a list of
# `Record`s.
Records = Iterable[Record]
GroupedRecords = Dict[str, Records]
KeyGroupedRecordsPair = Tuple[Key, GroupedRecords]
