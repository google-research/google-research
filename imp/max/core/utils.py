  This is an SPMD-friendly implementation of array assignment in jax.numpy. The
  current implementation e.g. `array.at[..., indices, ...].set(updates)` may
  introduce overhead under a pjitted graph. Hence, we use this function for any
  array assignment in our pipeline.
  We first construct a sparse array out of `updates` with the same shape as
  `inputs`. This sparse array only contains non-zero values in the positions,
  `indices`, along the dimension `axis`. We also construct a mask with the same
  shape as `inputs`. This mask contains 0s in positions `indices` along the
  dimension `axis` and 1s elsewhere. We then construct the final array by
  `outputs = mask * inputs + sparse_updates` which results in an array with
  exactly the same values as `inputs.at[..., indices, ...].set(updates)`. A
  batched assignment is also supported (e.g. in applications where each sample
  in the batch may have its own `indices`, hence resulting in batched assignment
  along certain axis of the inputs).

  Args:
    inputs: An array with rank > 1.
    updates: An array with the same rank as inputs, and a shape whose non-`axis`
      dimensions should be broadcastable to inputs'. For example, if inputs
      has a shape of [batch, instance, length, dim] and we want to update
      its 'length' axis, the 'updates' array should have a shape brodcastable
      to [batch, instance, len(indices), dim].
    indices: An integer OR a sequence of integer numbers OR an array containing
      integer numbers, indicating the indices of the to-be-scattered elements in
      inputs' axis dimension. This arg could hold multiple shapes depending on
      the application. For example, assuming that an input with shape of
      [batch, instance, length, dim] is given, one can feed indices=0 and axis=2
      and expect to scatter the first element along the `length` dimension. One
      can also feed `indices = [0, 5]` and `axis = 2` and fetch the first and
      the sixth elements along the `length` axis. It is also acceptable to feed
      sample-specific indices and expect an ND scatter. For example, the
      `indices` arg could be an array with shape [batch, instance, num_indices]
      and scatter batch/instance-specific samples along `axis = 2`. In this case
      the user should also specify `batch_dims`=(0, 1) and `inputs`, `updates`,
      and `indices` should all have the same `batch` and `instance` dimensions.
    axis: An integer indicating the dimension in which we want to update the
      elements.
    batch_dims: A sequence of integers indicating the batch dims on both inputs
      and indices (if any). If provided, indices should have a rank of
      `len(batch_dims) + 1` and its batch dims should exactly have the same
      value as the `inputs`' and `updates`'.
