  """Scans a module with same config and returns the configurable stack.

  jax.lax.scan and its lifted versions under Flax have strict assumptions.
  The (to-be-scanned) module should only accept an init followed by carry
  arguments: inputs, carry. It should also output the transformed init and its
  carry: outputs, carry. We use the following wrapper to resolve the issue for
  inputs:
    class ScannedOutputModule(module):
        def __call__(self, inputs, *args):
          return super().__call__(inputs, *args), None
  This enables us to scan any layer without touching its input/output signature.
  However, this limits the way we can call the scanned module. The call should
  only be ordered positional arguments: outputs = module(arg1, arg2). Calling
  the module using outputs = module(arg1=value1, arg2=value2) would result in
  two types of error:
    ValueError: Tuple arity mismatch: 0 != 1; tuple: ()
        scan does not understand which argument in carry to broadcast or map.
    TypeError: inner() missing 1 required positional argument: 'init'.
        scan does not understand which argument is inputs and which is carry
  This wrapper is generic enough to accommodate with most usecases. However, it
  assumes that the to-be-scanned module has this input structure:
  inputs, carry1, carry2, ... and user should call it with same order.

  Args:
    module: The to-be-instantiated flax module.
    length: The number of layer instantiations.
    scan_axis: The weight stacking axis.
    in_axes: The axis along which the inputs are split (to be fed to the scanned
      layers).
    out_axes: The axis along which the outputs are stacked.
    sharding_axis: The spmd sharding axis.
    rng_keys: The rng array mappings.

  Returns:
    The scanned layer.
