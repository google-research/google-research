    This piece of code is borrowed from `t5x.examples.scalable_t5.layers`.
    This method is called twice, first to initialize the cache and then for
    an actual decoding process. The two calls are differentiated by the
    presence of 'cached_key' in the variable dict. In the cache initialization
    stage, the cache variables are initialized as zeros and will be filled
    in the subsequent decoding process.

    In the cache initialization call, `query` has a shape:
    [batch, instance, q_length, d_q] and `key`/`value` have a shape:
    [batch, instance, kv_length, d_kv]. During the incremental decoding stage,
    query, key and value all have the shape [batch, instance, 1, qkv_features]
    corresponding to a single step.

    Args:
      query: input queries of shape `[batch, instance, q_length, d_q]`
      key: input keys of shape `[batch, instance, kv_length, d_kv]`
      value: input values of shape `[batch, instance, kv_length, d_kv]`
      attention_mask: attention mask of shape
        `[batch, instance, 1, q_length, kv_length]`.
      attention_bias: attention bias of shape
        `[1, num_heads, q_length, kv_length]`.
