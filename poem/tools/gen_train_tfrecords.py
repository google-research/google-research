"""Generates training TFRecords from 2D keypoint CSV and 3D keypoint H5 files.

The CSV file is expected to have:

1. The first row as header as follows:

image/object/subject,image/subaction,image/object/camera,image/frame_index,image/width,image/height,image/object/part/NOSE_TIP/center/x,image/object/part/NOSE_TIP/center/y,image/object/part/NOSE_TIP/score,image/object/part/LEFT_SHOULDER/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_SHOULDER/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_SHOULDER/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_SHOULDER/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_SHOULDER/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_SHOULDER/score,image/object/part/LEFT_ELBOW/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_ELBOW/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_ELBOW/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_ELBOW/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_ELBOW/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_ELBOW/score,image/object/part/LEFT_WRIST/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_WRIST/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_WRIST/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_WRIST/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_WRIST/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_WRIST/score,image/object/part/LEFT_HIP/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_HIP/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_HIP/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_HIP/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_HIP/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_HIP/score,image/object/part/LEFT_KNEE/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_KNEE/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_KNEE/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_KNEE/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_KNEE/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_KNEE/score,image/object/part/LEFT_ANKLE/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_ANKLE/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_ANKLE/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_ANKLE/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_ANKLE/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_ANKLE/score,image/object/subject,image/subaction,image/object/camera,image/frame_index,image/width,image/height,image/object/part/NOSE_TIP/center/x,image/object/part/NOSE_TIP/center/y,image/object/part/NOSE_TIP/score,image/object/part/LEFT_SHOULDER/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_SHOULDER/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_SHOULDER/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_SHOULDER/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_SHOULDER/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_SHOULDER/score,image/object/part/LEFT_ELBOW/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_ELBOW/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_ELBOW/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_ELBOW/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_ELBOW/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_ELBOW/score,image/object/part/LEFT_WRIST/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_WRIST/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_WRIST/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_WRIST/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_WRIST/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_WRIST/score,image/object/part/LEFT_HIP/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_HIP/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_HIP/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_HIP/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_HIP/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_HIP/score,image/object/part/LEFT_KNEE/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_KNEE/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_KNEE/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_KNEE/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_KNEE/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_KNEE/score,image/object/part/LEFT_ANKLE/center/x,image/object/part/LEFT_ANKLE/center/y,image/object/part/LEFT_ANKLE/score,image/object/part/RIGHT_ANKLE/center/x,image/object/part/RIGHT_ANKLE/center/y,image/object/part/RIGHT_ANKLE/score

2. The following rows are CSV values according to the header, a pair of samples
   per row for the same 3D pose from two different camera views.

Below is a dummy sample CSV row:

S1,Eating,60457274,001346,1000,1002,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,0.1234,0.4321,1.0,S1,Eating,58860488,001346,1000,1000,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0,0.2468,0.2155,1.0

Notes:
a. The "image/frame_index" values are expected to start at 0.
b. The 2D keypoint coordinate values are required to be normalized by image
   sizes to within [0, 1].
c. The 3D keypoint coordinate values are assumed to be unnormalized.
d. In practice, we include all possible pairs in our training tables. For
   example, for one pose in the Human3.6M dataset (which has 4 views C{0..3}),
   we include all 12 pairs in the CSV, i.e., (C0, C1), (C0, C2), (C0, C3), (C1,
   C0), (C1, C2), (C1, C3), (C2, C0), (C2, C1), (C2, C3), (C3, C0), (C3, C1),
   and (C3, C2).

The H5 files contain 3D poses from Human3.6M and CSV files contain 2D poses.
Produces TFRecords file for input into training pipelines. The instructions
for downloading the H5 files are located in the Github page:
https://github.com/una-dinosauria/3d-pose-baseline.
