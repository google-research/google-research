"""Utilities for reading and writing files of graphs.

We use graphml format because it's the only one I could find that preserves all
the graph and vertex attributes.

As a (beautiful?) hack, we keep all the output in a single file by dumping a
dictionary of statistics into an igraph object at the end of the file. For
example, to apply rejection sampling to get a uniform sampling of graphs, we
need to know the importance weight of each graph, but also the maximum
importance of any graph.
