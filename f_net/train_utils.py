  Interprets factors in the factors string which can consist of:
  * constant: Interpreted as the constant value.
  * linear_warmup: Interpreted as linear warmup until warmup_steps.
  * rsqrt_decay: Divide by square root of max(step, warmup_steps).
  * linear_decay: Linearly decays to zero from maximum rate.
  * cosine_decay: Cyclic cosine decay, uses decay_steps parameter.

  Args:
    factors: Factors separated by "*" that defines the schedule.
    base_learning_rate: The starting constant for the learning rate schedule.
    warmup_steps: How many steps to warm up for in the warmup schedule.

      rate (following warm-up), when using linear or cosine decay.
