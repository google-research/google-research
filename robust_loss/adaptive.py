  This loss behaves differently from general.lossfun() and

  the shape and scale of the loss, and allow for arbitrary sized inputs. This
  loss only allows for rank-2 inputs, and expects those inputs to be of the form
  [batch_index, dimension_index]. This module constructs the free parameters
  (TF variables) that define the alpha and scale parameters for each
  of the `num_channels` dimension of the input, such that all alphas are
  in (`alpha_lo`, `alpha_hi`) and all scales are in (`scale_lo`, Infinity).
  The assumption is that the input residual `x` is, say, a matrix where x[i,j]
  corresponds to a pixel at location j for image i, with the idea being that
  all pixels at location j should be modeled with the same shape and scale
  parameters across all images in the batch. If the user wants to fix alpha or
  scale to be a constant, this can be done by setting `alpha_lo=alpha_hi` or
  `scale_lo=scale_init` respectively.
