  This is a weird hand-crafted function designed to take in alpha values and

  is only varied in [0, 4] and is especially interesting around alpha=2, this
  curve is roughly linear in [0, 4] with a slope of ~1 at alpha=0 and alpha=4
  but a slope of ~10 at alpha=2. When alpha > 4 the curve becomes logarithmic.
  Some (input, output) pairs for this function are:
    [(0, 0), (1, ~1.2), (2, 4), (3, ~6.8), (4, 8), (8, ~8.8), (400000, ~12)]

      alpha: The shape parameter of the NLL (\alpha in the paper), where more
        negative values cause outliers to "cost" more and inliers to "cost"
        less. Alpha can be any non-negative value, but the gradient of the NLL
        with respect to alpha has singularities at 0 and 2 so you may want to
        limit usage to (0, 2) during gradient descent. Must be a tensorflow

        smooth interpolation between a Cauchy distribution (alpha = 0) and a
