  This loss is used as reconstruction loss in the paper 'Deep Set Prediction
  Networks' https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06565, see Eq. 2. For each element in the
  batches we wish to compute min_{pi} ||y_i - x_{pi(i)}||^2 where pi is a
  permutation of the set elements. We first compute the pairwise distances
  between each point in both sets and then match the elements using the scipy
  implementation of the Hungarian algorithm. This is applied for every set in
  the two batches. Note that if the number of points does not match, some of the
  elements will not be matched. As distance function we use the Huber loss.

  Args:
    x: Batch of sets of size [batch_size, n_points, dim_points]. Each set in the
      batch contains n_points many points, each represented as a vector of
      dimension dim_points.
    y: Batch of sets of size [batch_size, n_points, dim_points].

  Returns:

  This function computes the average precision of the predictions specifically
  for the CLEVR dataset. First, we sort the predictions of the model by
  confidence (highest confidence first). Then, for each prediction we check
  whether there was a corresponding object in the input image. A prediction is
  considered a true positive if the discrete features are predicted correctly
  and the predicted position is within a certain distance from the ground truth
  object.

  Args:
    pred: Tensor of shape [batch_size, num_elements, dimension] containing
      predictions. The last dimension is expected to be the confidence of the
      prediction.
    attributes: Tensor of shape [batch_size, num_elements, dimension] containing
      ground-truth object properties.
