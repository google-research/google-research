  Sample usage:
  1. When a matching function is provided, you can use the smart_score() fn:
    scorer = SmartScorer(matching_fn=matcher)
    score = scorer.smart_score(
        'This is the first sentence. This one is the second.',
        'The first sentence is this. This follows the first.')

  2. When a matching function is not provided, you can use the
       smart_score_precomputed() fn providing a score_matrix which contains the
       scores for all pairs of sentences in the reference and candidate texts.
       This one is particularly useful with model-based matchers such as
       BLEURT, ANLI, etc.:

    Note that the unit of ngrams here are chunks of tokens (sentences by
      default). This is different from the token-level ngrams used in standard
      ROUGE.
