  This is the core function for applying attention based on
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762. It calculates the attention weights given
  query and key and combines the values using the attention weights.

  Note: query, key, value needn't have any batch dimensions.

  Args:
    query: queries for calculating attention with shape of `[batch..., q_length,
      num_heads, qk_depth_per_head]`.
    key: keys for calculating attention with shape of `[batch..., kv_length,
      num_heads, qk_depth_per_head]`.
    value: values to be used in attention with shape of `[batch..., kv_length,
      num_heads, v_depth_per_head]`.
    bias: bias for the attention weights. This should be broadcastable to the
      shape `[batch..., num_heads, q_length, kv_length]`. This can be used for
      incorporating causal masks, padding masks, proximity bias, etc.
    mask: mask for the attention weights. This should be broadcastable to the
      shape `[batch..., num_heads, q_length, kv_length]`. This can be used for
      incorporating causal masks. Attention weights are masked out if their
      corresponding mask value is `False`.
    broadcast_dropout: bool: use a broadcasted dropout along batch dims.
    dropout_rng: JAX PRNGKey: to be used for dropout
    dropout_rate: dropout rate
    deterministic: bool, deterministic or not (to apply dropout)
    dtype: the dtype of the computation (default: infer from inputs)
    precision: numerical precision of the computation see `jax.lax.Precision`
      for details.
    return_attention: returns attention weights.

  Returns:
