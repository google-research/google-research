"""Create a label map file for Felix and FelixPointer.

Felix label map files are created by converting existing lasertagger
label map files. Laserpointer assumes that if a phrase can be inserted then
all subphrases can also be inserted. This is not the case with lasertagger.

Felix label map file consists of inserting up to N number of MASKS.
