"""Utilities for optimizing phrase vocabulary for Felix.

The goal is to find a fixed-size set of phrases that cover as many training
examples as possible. Based on the phrases, saves a file containing all possible
tags to be predicted and another file reporting the percentage of covered
training examples with different vocabulary sizes.
