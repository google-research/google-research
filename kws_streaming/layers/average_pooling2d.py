  """AveragePooling2D layer.

  It is convolutional AveragePooling2D based on depthwise_conv2d.
  It can be useful for cases where AveragePooling2D has to run in streaming mode

  The input data with shape [batch_size, time1, feature1, feature2]
  are processed by depthwise conv with fixed weights, all weights values
  are equal to 1.0/(size_in_time_1*size_in_feature1).
  Averaging is done in 'time1' and 'feature1' dims.
  Conv filter has size [size_in_time_1, size_in_feature1, feature2],
  where first two dims are specified by user and
  feature2 is defiend by the last dim of input data.

  So if kernel_size = [time1, feature1]
  output will be [batch_size, time1, 1, feature2]

  Attributes:
    kernel_size: 2D kernel size - defines the dims
      which will be eliminated/averaged.
    strides: stride for each dim, with size 4
    padding: defiens how to pad
    dilation_rate: dilation rate in which we sample input values
      across the height and width
    **kwargs: additional layer arguments
