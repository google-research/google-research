"""Extract images from summaries.

During training, we save image summaries. This extracts the images and dumps
them in a log directory.

Flags: target log dir,
dump dir

We would want, for each dataset:
samples from all of the methods

each dataset should have a folder
images in the folder should have the method name + sample #, then we can
combine the images together or do that in latex/generate latex code to do that
