"""Script for converting from csv file datafiles to a directory for each image.

This matches how it is loaded by MAML code.

Acquire miniImagenet from Ravi & Larochelle '17, along with the train, val, and
test csv files. Put the
csv files in the miniImagenet directory and put the images in the directory
'miniImagenet/images/'.
Then run this script from the miniImagenet directory:
    cd data/miniImagenet/
    python proc_images.py
