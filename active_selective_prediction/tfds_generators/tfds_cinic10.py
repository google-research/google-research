_DESCRIPTION = """
CINIC-10 is a drop-in replacement for CIFAR-10.
We compiled it as a benchmarking datset because CIFAR-10 can be too small/too easy and ImageNet is often too large/difficult.
ImageNet32 and ImageNet64 are smaller than ImageNet but even more difficult. CINIC-10 fills this benchmarking gap.
CINIC-10 has a total of 270,000 images equally split amonst three subsets: train, validate, and test.
In each subset (90,000 images) there are ten classes (identical to CIFAR-10 classes).
There are 9,000 images per class per subset. Using the suggested data split (an equal three-way split).
CINIC-10 has 1.8 times as many training samples than CIFAR-10.
CINIC-10 is designed to be directly swappable with CIFAR-10.
