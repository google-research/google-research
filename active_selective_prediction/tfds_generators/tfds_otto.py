_DESCRIPTION = """
Otto Group Product Classification dataset.

The Otto Group is one of the world's biggest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in more than 20 countries, including Crate & Barrel (USA), Otto.de (Germany) and 3 Suisses (France).
We are selling millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to our product line.

A consistent analysis of the performance of our products is crucial. However, due to our diverse global infrastructure, many identical products get classified differently.
Therefore, the quality of our product analysis depends heavily on the ability to accurately cluster similar products.
The better the classification, the more insights we can generate about our product range.
