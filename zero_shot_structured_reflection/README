The exact reproduction of our paper requires access to a PaLM model.
In case such access is not available, please follow the reflection algorithm in ``run_miniwob_task.py`` and the reflection log in ``notebook/LLM_miniwob_release.ipynb`` for better reproduction.

The main body of the algorithm is in ``run_miniwob_task.py``. The miniwob environmental infrastructure will likely need some manual fix to be runnable depending on your devices. Please let us know if you run into any issues related to that.
