    # Python namedtuples like FilterMultiplier inherit from `tuple`, and tuples
    # are ordered lexicographically. For example, when determining whether
    # (x1, x2, x3) < (y1, y2, y3), we first compare x1 and y1. If x1 < y1, the
    # inequality is true. If they're equal, we next compare x2 and y2.
    # And so on.
