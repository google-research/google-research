"""Constants used in dual encoder SMITH model."""

# Constants related to training mode.
# There are three different modes for the model training:
# Joint_train: the loss includes both masked LM losses and the text matching
# loss.
# Pretrain: the loss includes masked word LM loss and masked sentence LM loss.
# The masked sentence LM loss only applies to the dual encoder SMITH model.
# Finetune: the loss includes the text matching loss.
