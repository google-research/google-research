"""Large Margin Loss Function.

Let d be the estimated distance to boundary, and gamma and alpha
are margin loss parameters (gamma > 0 and alpha > 0).

The original margin loss can be written as:

loss = max(0, min(gamma - d, alpha * gamma))

The formulation written here can be obtained as:
min(gamma - d, alpha * gamma)
  = gamma + min(-d, alpha * gamma - gamma)
  = gamma - max(d, gamma - alpha * gamma)
  = gamma - max(d, gamma * (1-alpha))

One can see from here that the lower bound to distance to boundary is
distance_lower = gamma * (1-alpha).

loss = max(0, gamma - max(d, distance_lower))
Looking further:
loss = gamma + max(-gamma, -max(d, distance_lower))
     = gamma - min(gamma, max(d, distance_lower))

One can see from here that the distance is upper bounded by gamma.

  Args:

    layers_list: List of network Tensors at different layers. The large margin
      is enforced at the layers specified.
    gamma: Desired margin, and distance to boundary above the margin will be
      clipped.
    alpha_factor: Factor to determine the lower bound of margin. Both gamma and
      alpha_factor determine points to include in training the margin these
      points lie with distance to boundary of [gamma * (1 - alpha), gamma]

      less computationally expensive training.

    layers_weights: (List of float) Weight for loss from each layer.
    loss_collection: Collection to which the loss will be added.

  Raises:
