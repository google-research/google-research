  This synthesizer only works for sequential subgraphs (see sequential.py).

  There are three modes for the progressive synthesizer.
  - GREEDY selects the op which maximizes the progress at each step.
  - UNIFORM selects an op uniformly at random from the ops which make progress.
  - WEIGHTED selects an op weighted by the amount of progress it makes.

  For weighted, each op is selected with probability proportional to
    1. / (dist + self.eps)

      subgraphs_and_props: A list of tuples providing subgraphs providing the
        enclosing contexts into which the synthesized subgraph will be embedded,
        and the properties for each instantiation to satisfy. Note that each
        subgraph will have the same graph, but differing constants, state, and
        inputs.
      generation: The generation of the new subgraph, the value of which must be
        incremented at least once every time a graph is selected to have a
        subgraph in it replaced. This is primarily to ensure that the
        synthesizer is easily able to generate unique names for any newly
        inserted nodes.
      abstract: Whether the properties of the synthesize subgraph need to to
        satisfy the properties abstractly or concretely (i.e., using actual
        values).
      mode: the progressive synthesizer mode.
      max_len: the maximum length of the subgraph to synthesize.
      max_delta: the maximum additional length over the number of ops in the
        original graph to synthesize.
      min_len: the minimum length of the subgraph to synthesize.
      min_delta: the minimum difference from the number of ops in the original
        graph to synthesize.
      eps: the minimum amount of probability to add for WEIGHTED mode.
      exp: the power to raise the weights to for WEIGHTED mode.
      p: the probability of continuing once the distance is 0.
      filter_progress: whether to only select ops that make positive progress.
