"""Abstract base class for a synthesizer.

At a high level, a synthesizer is given a set of abstract properties, and
returns a (sub)graph satisfying the properties. We also provide the enclosing
context into which the subgraph will be embedded, since some of the abstract
properties require this context to evaluate.
