"""Base class for abstract property inference.

Abstract properties are properties defined for computation (sub)graphs. They are
abstract in the sense that non-equivalent graphs (as defined by input-output
behavior) may have the same value for a given abstract property.

An illustrative example of an abstract property is the shape of the output
tensor (given the shape of the input tensor).
