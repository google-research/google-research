def match_params(params_dict,
                 struct_to_match):
  """Matches the params in params_dict to the tree structure of struct_to_match.

  This function maps between the JAX model.Model param representations and a
  more conventional Flax model. The main challenge in substituting one set of
  parameters for another is that the Flax model often includes nested modules,
  which results in the parameters following a tree structure. In contrast, our
  model class executes the computation graph in a single module, so that the
  parameters are just a simple list.

  Thus we adopt a convention in our parameter names: to a first approximation,
  the parameter with key "a/b/c/d" is equivalent to the nested dictionary
    {a: {b: {c: {d: param}}}}

  To ensure that this operation does not map two different parameters to the
  same flat key, we will assume that the keys in any (sub)dictionary are
  prefix-free, e.g., if A is a key, then AB is not a key, where A and B are any
  two strings and AB is their concatenation.

  Then it holds that we can map any nested dictionary to a flattened
  representation, e.g.,
    {a: {b: {c: {d: param}}}} => {a/b/c/d: param}

  Capitalization does not matter.

  Args:
    params_dict: the dictionary of params
    struct_to_match: the new dictionary structure to match

  Returns:
    a dictionary of params organized according to struct_to_match
