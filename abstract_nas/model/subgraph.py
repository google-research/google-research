  """Finds and replaces subgraph in graph.

  A subgraph is a list of ops in topological order.
  A subgraph is specified almost the same way as a graph, with one crucial
  difference: each op has an associated list of ``output_names''
  SubgraphNode(
    op=Op(name="layer1/gelu/1",
       type=Op.OpType.GELU,
       input_names=["layer1/conv"]),
    output_names=["layer1/relu"])
  )
  For each name in the output_names field, we update any ops in the old graph
  which consume the specified tensor with the corresponding output of the
  subgraph's op. In this case, any tensors which specified ``layer1/relu'' as an
  input value will instead receive ``layer1/gelu/1:0'' in that slot. Ops which
  produce multple outputs will specify additional tensors in the
  ``output_values'' (which correspond in order to the output tensors of the op).

  Our first step is to gather the mapping from inputs in the old graph to the
  corresponding new inputs in the subgraph. Any inputs which are not specified
  to be replaced retain their inputs in the old graph.

  We next insert all the subgraph nodes into the graph according to the first
  instance they are insertable (i.e., the first position in the topologically
  flattened graph at which all the required inputs would precede the node).

  Finally, we remove nodes with dangling outputs--those whose outputs are not
  backward reachable from the output tensor. For instance, in the example above,
  "layer1/relu" would be removed since we have updated any node which consumes
  its output to take "layer1/gelu/1" as input instead.

  Does NOT rigorously check to see if the replacement generates a legal graph
  i.e., the subgraph outputs may not have the same shapes as the original ops.
  This should be done by running a ShapeModel.

    graph: the old graph
