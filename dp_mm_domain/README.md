The three run_*_experiment.py scripts run the corresponding experiments.
Guidelines for downloading and preprocessing data can be found in datasets.py.

For example, after downloading and preprocessing the Reddit dataset using
datasets.preprocess_reddit, set union experiments can be run using
python -m run_set_union_experiment.py.
