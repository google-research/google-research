r"""A library for computing spherical harmonics.

The spherical harmonics are special functions defined on the surface of a
sphere, which are often used to solve partial differential equations in many
scientific applications. A physical field defined on the surface of a sphere can
be written as a linear superposition of the spherical harmonics as the latter
form a complete set of orthogonal basis functions. The set of spherical
harmonics denoted `Y_l^m(θ, φ)` is often called Laplace's spherical
harmonics of degree `l` and order `m` and `θ` and `φ` are colatitude and
longitude, respectively. In addition, the spherical harmonics can be expressed
as `Y_l^m(θ, φ) = P_l^m(θ) \exp(i m φ)`, in which
`P_l^m(θ)` is the associated Legendre function with embedded normalization
constant \sqrt(1 / (4 𝛑)). We refer to the function f(θ, φ) with finite induced
norm as the signal on the sphere, where the colatitude θ ∈ [0, π] and longitude
φ ∈ [0, 2π). The signal on the sphere can be written as a linear superpostiion
of the spherical harmoincs, which form a complete set of orthonormal basis
functions for degree l ≥ 0 and order |m| ≤ l. In this library, θ and φ can be
non-uniformly sampled.
