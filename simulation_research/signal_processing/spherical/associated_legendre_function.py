def gen_normalized_legendre(l_max,

  r"""Computes the normalized associated Legendre functions (ALFs).

  The ALFs of the first kind are used in spherical harmonics. The spherical
  harmonic of degree `l` and order `m` can be written as
  `Y_l^m(Œ∏, œÜ) = N_l^m * P_l^m(cos(Œ∏)) * exp(i m œÜ)`, where `N_l^m` is the
  normalization factor and Œ∏ and œÜ are the colatitude and longitude,
  repectively. `N_l^m` is chosen in the way that the spherical harmonics form
  a set of orthonormal basis function of L^2(S^2). For the computational
  efficiency of spherical harmonics transform, the normalization factor is
  embedded into the computation of the ALFs. In addition, normalizing `P_l^m`
  avoids overflow/underflow and achieves better numerical stability. Three
  recurrence relations are used in the computation. Note that the factor of
  \sqrt(1 / (4 ùõë)) is used in the formulation.

  Args:
    l_max: The maximum degree of the associated Legendre function. Both the
      degrees and orders are `[0, 1, 2, ..., l_max]`.
    x: A vector of type `float32`, `float64` containing the sampled points in
      spherical coordinates, at which the ALFs are computed; `x` is essentially
      `cos(Œ∏)`.

  Returns:
    The 3D array of shape `(l_max + 1, l_max + 1, len(x))` containing the
    normalized values of the ALFs at `x`.
