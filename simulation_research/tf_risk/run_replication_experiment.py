"""Run an experiment of the synthesis of a basket call with mc methods.

Consider we are selling an European basket call option which in general cannot
be priced or hedged analytically and cannot be replicated statically even
under a simple Black-Scholes model for the dynamics of the underlyings.

For simplicity, bid-ask spread and fees are not taken into account.

We simulate correlated stock price variations under the historical probability
and hedge at each time period with a delta computed by a Monte Carlo method
(path-wise differentiation) under the risk neutral probability.
Tensorflow's automated differentiation capabilities make such a Monte Carlo
simulation simple to differentiate to extract the delta and easy to accelerate
on GPU/TPU.

See http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~touzi/Poly-MAP552.pdf p99 7.4.2.
