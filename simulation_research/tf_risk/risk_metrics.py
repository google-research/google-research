  """Compute VaR and CVaR given a portfoolio return simulation graph.

  Given an initial position and value for a financial portfolio, Value-at-Risk
  (VaR) at level alpha is the opposite of the level 1 - alpha percentile of
  returns. In other words, it is the smallest loss that occurs with a
  probability less or equal to alpha. The Condition-VaR is the expected value
  of the loss conditioned on the fact that the loss is greater than the VaR.

  Args:
    portfolio_returns: a [num_samples] tensor of scalars, the simulated
      distribution of scalars for a given portfolio.
    var_levels: a [num_vars] list of scalars in [0, 1], the VaR levels to
      compute, typically [0.95, 0.98, 0.999].
    key_placeholder: the placeholder entailing the key for the sub-stream of
      pseudo or quasi random numbers.
    feed_dict: an optional dictionary of values to put in placeholders for the
      portfolio_returns graph to use.
    num_batches: the number of portfolio simulations to run. The estimated
      distribution will have num_samples * num_batches samples.
    tf_session: (optional) tensorflow session.

  Returns:
    a [num_vars] array of var estimates, a [num_vars] array of cvar estimates.
