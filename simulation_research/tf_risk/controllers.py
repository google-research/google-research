"""Self-financing replicating portfolio controllers.

To replicate a sold derivative on some underlying asset two basic operations are
needed:
  1) Give an estimate, in the present market conditions, of the price of
the derivative. This determines how much initial cash is needed to initiate
the self-financing portfolio that replicates the derivative. The self-financing
portfolio is controlled to be equal in value to the derivative's payoff
at maturity.
  2) Give an estimate, in the present market conditions, of the hedging vector
of the derivative (usually called delta, it is typically the sensitivity of
the derivative's price w.r.t. the underlying asset price vector).

Both corresponding wrappers around tensorflow computation graphs are provided
here.
