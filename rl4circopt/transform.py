  # separated by other operations. If successful, we obtain as a side effect
  # the segmentation for the other operations (i.e. the "context") into the
  # subcircuits "before", "between" and "after".
  #
  # To this end, we first check whether the selected operation pair trivially
  # commutes with all operations in between. If we find this condition
  # violated, the game is not yet over. For illustration, we consider the
  # following situation (the pair to be checked are the marked operations A and
  # D):
  #
  #   operation A on qubits [1, 3]   (*)
  #   operation B on qubits [1]
  #   operation C on qubits [?]
  #   operation D on qubits [3, 4]   (*)
  #
  # Here, operation B does not commute trivially with operation A. Depending
  # on the qubits that operation C acts on, we can still be successful: if
  # operation C either trivially commutes with operation A and B, or if it
  # trivially commutes with operation D.
  #
  # The general pattern is the following: All operations which do not trivially
  # commute with the first operation of the pair have to be performed after the
  # second operation, as well as all operations which do not trivially commute
  # with those operations that do not trivially commute with the first
  # operation, and so on recursively. Analogically, all operations which do not
  # trivially commute with the second operation of the pair have to be performed
  # before the first operation, as well as all operations which do not trivially
  # commute with those operations that do not trivially commute with the second
  # operation, and so on recursively.
  #
  # To resolve all possible cases, we proceed as follows (first and second
  # operation refers to the selected pair):
  #  * We define a pool of operations. The operations in this pool are the ones
  #    which cannot be moved before the first operation, and thus have to be
  #    moved after the second one.
  #    We build this pool as follows: For the first operation and every new
  #    member to the pool, we will add each operation between this and the
  #    second operation (exclusively) to the pool unless it trivially commutes
  #    with this operation. We go on doing this until the pool consists entirely
  #    of operations which have already been visited.
  #    Example: All the operations below marked with a star end up in the pool.
  #    The second argument tells because of which operation (that it does not
  #    trivially commute with) it has been added to the pool.
  #
  #        operation_first  on qubits [1, 3]
  #        operation A      on qubits [1, 2, 5]   (*, operation_first)
  #        operation B      on qubits [4]
  #        operation C      on qubits [4, 6]
  #        operation D      on qubits [2, 7]      (*, operation A)
  #        operation E      on qubits [4, 5]      (*, operation A)
  #        operation F      on qubits [4, 7]      (*, operation D or E)
  #        operation_second on qubits [???]
  #
  #  * We define a second pool of operations. The operations in this pool are
  #    the ones which cannot be moved after the second operation, and thus have
  #    to be moved before the first one.
