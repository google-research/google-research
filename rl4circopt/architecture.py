    # We want to decompose a given single-qubit gate U into PhasedX and RotZ
    # gates. For this, we make the following ansatz:
    #
    #     ───U───   ≡   ───PhasedX(beta, -alpha)───RotZ(phi)───
    #
    # To obtain the parameters of the PhasedX and RotZ gate, we perform an Euler
    # angle decomposition for the pauli_transform of U.
    #
    # This can be motivated as follows. We have
    #
    #     PhasedX(beta, -alpha).pauli_transform ==
    #         == dot(Rz(-alpha), Rx(beta), Rz(alpha))
    #     RotZ(phi).pauli_transform == Rz(phi)
    #
    # where Rx and Rz are 3D rotations around the x and z axis, respectively.
    # From this, we get:
    #
    #     dot(RotZ(phi), PhasedX(alpha, beta)).pauli_transform ==
    #         == dot(Rz(phi-alpha), Rx(beta), Rz(alpha))
    #
    # The right-hand side is exactly the Euler angle decomposition with
    # signature 'zxz' and angles [alpha, beta, phi-alpha], which gives us a
    # direct way to extract the parameters for the two gates. Below, the angle
    # gamma will substitute phi-alpha.
    #
    # Note 1: The fact that this Euler angle decomposition is possible for every
    # SO(3) rotation, i.e. every possible Pauli transform, is one way to prove
    # universality for the combination of the PhasedX and RotZ gate.
    #
    # Note 2: In the calculation above, we have reversed two times the order of
    # the operations. This is because in circuit diagrams and for the Euler
    # angle decomposition (following the convention used in the corresponding
    # Scipy function), the first operation is left, whereas when multiplying the
    # associated operators, the first operation is right such that this is the
    # one applied first to the ket state (a vector multiplied from the right).

    # The two if-branches are special cases where the Euler decomposition into
    # 'zxz' is not anymore unique; here, we fix a choice that corresponds to
    # either just a PhasedX gate or just a RotZ gate, and thus minimizes the
    # total number of gates.
    #
    # In addition, the algorithm for Euler decomposition used in the else
    # branch seems to run into numerical precision issues for these cases; as
    # a positive side effect, these issues are circumvented.
