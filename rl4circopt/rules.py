"""Quantum circuit transformation rules.

TransformationRule is the abstract base class for all transformation rules. In
addition, this module contains various subclasses which implement concrete
transformation rules:
* InvertCnot
* CancelOperations
* ExchangeCommutingOperations
* ExchangePhasedXwithRotZ
* ExchangePhasedXwithControlledZ
* CompressLocalOperations

TransformationRuleSet allows to group several of those into one single
TransformationRule.

CircuitScanner is a helper class to scan a circuit for subgroups on which these
transformation rules can potentially be applied, e.g. pairs of operations for
PairTransformationRule.

# satisfy certain sanity constraints, in particular:
# * for PointTransformationRule and PairTransformationRule: if the focus does

  """Iterates over all attention circuits with two aligned operations in the focus.

  For each pair of operations in the circuit which are not separated by other
  operations, there will be one AttentionCircuit with only these two operations
  in the focus. The exact criterion for whether the operations are considered
  to be not separated by other operations is whether it is possible, by only
  exchanging trivially commuting operations, to transform the circuit such that
  there is no operation between them.

  Example: the two operations B and D (marked with a star) in the following
  circuit form such a pair.

      operation A on qubits [0, 1]
      operation B on qubits [1, 3]   (*)
      operation C on qubits [0]
      operation D on qubits [3, 4]   (*)
      operation E on qubits [1, 3]

  Operation C is no problem because it does not act on any qubit affected by B
  and D. Also, all operations before B or after D are no problem anyways.

  Note that "no operation in between acts on one of the qubits affected by one
  of the operations in the pair" is only a sufficient, but not a necessary
  criterion. For example, operations A' and C' in

      operation A' on qubits [1, 3]   (*)
      operation B' on qubits [1]
      operation C' on qubits [3, 4]   (*)

  still form a pair even though operation B' acts on qubit 1 which is affected
  by operation A'. The reason is that operation B' and C' commute trivially, so
  we can arrive at the circuit (A', C', B') for which the pair relation for
  operations A' and C' is obvious.

  This function always takes into account the minimal requirement to form a
  pair.

  This function is lazy, i.e. items are not computed before they are actually
  requested.

  For each maximal group of local (i.e. single-qubit) operations in the
  circuit which act on the same qubit and are not separated by other
  operations, there will be one AttentionCircuit with only these operations in
  the focus. The exact criterion for whether the operations are considered to
  be not separated by other operations is whether between the first and the
  last operation in the group, there is no other (multi-qubit) operation
  which acts on the same qubit. Maximal means that there are no more local
  operations on this qubit which could be attached (either before the first
  or after the last operation in the group).

  Example: the operations B, E and F (marked with a star) in the following
  circuit form such a local group.

      operation A on qubits [0, 1]
      operation B on qubits [2]      (*)

      operation F on qubits [2]      (*)

  Operations C and D are no problem because the do not affect qubit 2 (the
  qubit which all operations in the group act on). Also, all operations before
  operation B or after operation F, i.e. the first/last operation in the
  group, are no problem anyway.

  The group in this example is maximal. Note that operation H cannot be
  attached because operation G affects qubit 2 (the qubit which all operations
  in the group act on). An example for a non-maximal group is if operation F
  was missing.
