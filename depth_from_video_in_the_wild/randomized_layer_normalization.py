"""Implements Randomized LayerNormalization, a Batch Normalization substitute.

For every item in a batch and for every layer, we calculate the mean and
variance across the spatial dimensions, and multiply them by Gaussian noise with
a mean equal to 1.0 (at training time only). This improved the results compared
to batch normalization - more in https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04998.
