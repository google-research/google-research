  """Computes a loss that penalizes RGB and depth inconsistencies betwen frames.

  This function computes 3 losses that penalize inconsistencies between two
  frames: depth, RGB, and structural similarity. It IS NOT SYMMETRIC with
  respect to both frames. In particular, to address occlusions, it only
  penalizes depth and RGB inconsistencies at pixels where frame1 is closer to
  the camera than frame2. (Why? see https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04998). Therefore
  the intended usage pattern is running it twice - second time with the two
  frames swapped.

  Args:
    frame1transformed_depth: A transform_depth_map.TransformedDepthMap object
      representing the depth map of frame 1 after it was motion-transformed to
      frame 2, a motion transform that accounts for all camera and object motion
      that occurred between frame1 and frame2. The tensors inside
      frame1transformed_depth are of shape [B, H, W].

    frame2rgb: A tf.Tensor of shape [B, H, W, C] containing the RGB image at

      depth_error: A tf scalar, the depth mismatch error between the two frames.
      rgb_error: A tf scalar, the rgb mismatch error between the two frames.
      ssim_error: A tf scalar, the strictural similarity mismatch error between
        the two frames.
      depth_proximity_weight: A tf.Tensor of shape [B, H, W], representing a
        function that peaks (at 1.0) for pixels where there is depth consistency
        between the two frames, and is small otherwise.
      frame1_closer_to_camera: A tf.Tensor of shape [B, H, W, 1], a mask that is
