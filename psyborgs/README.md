# PsyBORGS - Psychometric Benchmark of Racism, Generalization, and Stereotyping


## Context

The recent progress in generative language models unlocked new possibilities notably for questions answering tasks. Can we use these new abilities to make the model pass well-established surveys unveiling societal stereotypes in the format of Multiple Choice Question ?

Such questionnaires are already established and calibrated baselines to measure bias and personality of populations, leveraging them to evaluate LLMs could be a credible and objective evaluation metric.


## Code
We will release the full code soon.
