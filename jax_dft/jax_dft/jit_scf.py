        locations.

  Besides, the for loop is replaced by jax.lax.scan so it is jit friendly.
  Otherwise, jit on GPU runs into issues for big amount of for loop steps.

  Args:
    locations: Float numpy array with shape (num_nuclei,), the locations of
        atoms.
    nuclear_charges: Float numpy array with shape (num_nuclei,), the nuclear
        charges.
    num_electrons: Integer, the number of electrons in the system. The first
        num_electrons states are occupid.
    num_iterations: Integer, the number of Kohn-Sham iterations.
    grids: Float numpy array with shape (num_grids,).
    xc_energy_density_fn: function takes density (num_grids,) and returns
        the energy density (num_grids,).
    interaction_fn: function takes displacements and returns
        float numpy array with the same shape of displacements.
    initial_density: Float numpy array with shape (num_grids,), initial guess
        of the density for Kohn-Sham calculation.
    alpha: Float between 0 and 1, density linear mixing factor, the fraction
        of the output of the k-th Kohn-Sham iteration.

        the (k+1)-th iteration. The output of the k-th Kohn-Sham iteration is
        completely ignored.
        If 1, the output density from the k-th Kohn-Sham iteration is fed into
        the (k+1)-th iteration, equivalent to no density mixing.
    alpha_decay: Float between 0 and 1, the decay factor of alpha. The mixing
        factor after k-th iteration is alpha * alpha_decay ** k.
    enforce_reflection_symmetry: Boolean, whether to enforce reflection
        symmetry.
    num_mixing_iterations: Integer, the number of density differences in the
        previous iterations to mix the density.
    density_mse_converge_tolerance: Float, the stopping criteria. When the MSE
        density difference between two iterations is smaller than this value,
        the Kohn Sham iterations finish. The outputs of the rest of the steps
        are padded by the output of the converged step. Set this value to
        negative to disable early stopping.
    stop_gradient_step: Integer, apply stop gradient on the output state of
        this step and all steps before. The first KS step is indexed as 0.

    KohnShamState, the states of all the Kohn-Sham iteration steps.
