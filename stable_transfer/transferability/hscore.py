"""H-score transferability metric implementation.

Bao, Yajie, et al. "An information-theoretic metric of transferability for task
transfer learning.". https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkxAUjRqY7.

We follow the official paper implementation in
https://github.com/YaojieBao/An-Information-theoretic-Metric-of-Transferability:

Input: features x, target labels y

CovX = getCov(x)
g = zeros_like(x)

for y_i in set(y):
  m_i = mean(x[y==y_i, :], axis=0)
  g[y==y_i] = m_i

CovY = getCov(g)
hscore = np.trace(np.dot(np.linalg.pinv(CovX, rcond=1e-15), CovY))
