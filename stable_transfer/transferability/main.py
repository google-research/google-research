"""Main file for Stable Transferability Experiments.

This file runs an stable transferability experiment, for example it computes
the LEEP score for a target dataset, provided a source model or architecture.
These results are saved on disk and subsequent calls to the same experiment will
simply load the results from disk.

Experiments are defined in config files (given using the --my_config flag).
See the examples (config_*.py) in this directory.
