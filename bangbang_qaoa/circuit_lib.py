"""Abstract functions and classes used to build the QAOA circuit in cirq.

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides a recipe on how to
parametrized a trial wavefunction of the ground state which can be solved
variationally.

Original paper:
A Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028


Different from the standard QAOA algorithm, we will allocate chunks of time to
apply either Hamiltonian, and optimize over these decisions.
