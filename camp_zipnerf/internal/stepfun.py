"""Tools for manipulating step functions (piecewise-constant 1D functions).

We have a shared naming and dimension convention for these functions.
All input/output step functions are assumed to be aligned along the last axis.
`t` always indicates the x coordinates of the *endpoints* of a step function.
`y` indicates unconstrained values for the *bins* of a step function
`w` indicates bin weights that sum to <= 1. `p` indicates non-negative bin
values that *integrate* to <= 1.
