"""Utilitites to train the proposed "fair" survival analysis models.

This module has utility functions to train and evaluate proposed survival
analysis models including,

1) Coupled Deep-Cox: Involves sharing representations between demographics
   followed by a separate Breslow Estimator for each demographic.

2) Coupled Deep-Cox VAE: Involves learning shared representations via the use
   of a Variational Auto-Encoder. The parameters of the VAE and the Cox layers
   are learnt jointly.

The module depends on tensorflow 2.

Not designed to be called directly, would be called when running a function from
fair_survival_analysis.fair_survival_analysis
