"""Utilitites to preprocess SEER and SUPPORT datasets.

This module has utility functions to load and preprocess the SEER and SUPPORT
datasets for learning and evaluation of Survival Analysis methods. Preprocessing
involves standard scaling of the features, excluding the protected attribute,
imputing the missing values (for SEER) and removing outliers.

Not designed to be called directly, would be called when running a function from
fair_survival_analysis.fair_survival_analysis
