"""Top Level interface with helper functions to run baselines and experiments.

This is the top level module that contains two functions, baseline_experiment()
and experiment() that run the survival analysis baselines and methods on the
SEER and SUPPORT datasets in a cross validation fashion. The module then outputs
the Expected Calibration Error and ROC characteristic at various event time
quantiles.

  Typical usage example:
  from fair_survival_analysis import fair_survival_analysis
  fair_survival_analysis.experiment(data='SUPPORT')
  fair_survival_analysis.baseline_experiment(data='SUPPORT')

  This is the top level function that is designed to be called directly from

  a cross validation fashion. The function then plots and outputs the Expected
  Calibration Error and ROC characteristic at various event time quantiles.

  Args:
    data:
      a string that determines the dataset to run experiments on. One of "SEER"

    quantiles:
      a list of event time quantiles at which the models are to be evaluated.
    prot_att:
      a string that specifies the column in the dataset that is to be treated
      as a protected attribute.
    groups:
      a list of two groups on which the survival analysis models are to be
      evaluated vis a vis accuracy and fairness.
    model:
      the choice of the baseline survival analysis model. One of "cph", "dcph",
      "dsm", "aft", "rsf"
    fair_strategy:
      string that specifies the fairness strategy to be used while running the
      experiment. One of None, "unawareness", "coupled".
    cv_folds:
      int that determines the number of Cross Validation folds.

  Returns:
    a Matplotlib figure with the ROC Curves and Reliability (Calibration) curves
