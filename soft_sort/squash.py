"""Implements different squashing strategies before applying the Sinkhorn algorithm.

The main purpose of those functions is to map the numbers we wish to sort into
the [0, 1] segment using an increasing function, such as a logistic map.

This logistic map, when applied on the output of a neural network,
redistributes the activations into [0,1] in a smooth adaptative way, helping
the numerical stability of the Sinkhorn algorithm while maintaining a
well behaved back propagation.

In case of a logistic sigmoid, this map is exactly the CDF of a logistic
distribution. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution for
details, in particular the variance of the distribution. In case of an atan
sigmoid, it is somewhat related to the CDF of a Cauchy
distribution and presents the advantage to have better behaved gradients.

In a such a logistic map, the points lying in the linear part of the map will
be well spread out on the [0, 1] segment, which will make them easier to sort.
Therefore, depending on which part of the distribution is of interest, we might
want to focus on one part of another, hence leading to different translations
before applying a squashing function.
