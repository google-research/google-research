   a: np.ndarray<float>[batch, n]: the weight of each input point. The sum of

   power: (float) the power of the distance for the cost function.
   epsilon: (float) the level of entropic regularization wanted.
   epsilon_0: (float) the initial level of entropic regularization.
   epsilon_decay: (float) a multiplicative factor applied at each iteration
    until reaching the epsilon value.
   threshold: (float) the relative threshold on the Sinkhorn error to stop the
    Sinkhorn iterations.
   inner_iterations: (int32) the Sinkhorn error is not recomputed at each

   A 5-tuple containing: the values of the conjugate variables f and g, the
   final value of the entropic parameter epsilon, the cost matrix and the number
