  This operator takes advantage of the fact that an exhaustive softsort is not
  required to recover a single quantile. Instead, one can transport all
  input values in x onto only 3 weighted values. Target weights are adjusted so
  that those values in x that are transported to the middle value in the target
  vector y correspond to those concentrating around the quantile of interest.

  This idea generalizes to more quantiles, interleaving small weights on the
  quantile indices and bigger weights in between, corresponding to the gap from
  one desired quantile to the next one.

  Args:
   x: np.ndarray<float> of any shape.
   quantile: (float) the quantile to be returned.
   quantile_width: (float) mass given to the bucket supposed to attract points
    whose value concentrate around the desired quantile value. Bigger width
    means that we allow the soft quantile to be a mixture of
    more points further away from the quantile. If None, the width is set at 1/n
    where n is the number of values considered (the size along the 'axis').
   axis: (int) the axis along which to compute the quantile.
   **kwargs: see SoftQuantilizer for possible extra parameters.

  Returns:
    A np.ndarray<float> similar to the input tensor, but without the axis
    dimension that is squeezed into a single value: its soft quantile.
