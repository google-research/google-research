  """jnp.logaddexp, but safe if x1 and x2 are both -inf.

  We redefine the gradient of logaddexp such that if both are -inf, the
  gradient is zero. Strictly speaking, this may not be mathematically correct,
  but it works if we are taking the gradient of something like

    logaddexp(logaddexp(-inf + x, -inf + y), c + z)

  with respect to [x, y, z]. Essentially, as long as the things we are taking
  gradients for are finite, -inf implies that we decided this option is
  impossible, so it should have zero gradient flowing to the conditional for
  that option.

    x1: First value.
