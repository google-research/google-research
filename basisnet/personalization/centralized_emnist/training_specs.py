  """Contains information for creating a federated training task.

  This class contains a callable `iterative_process_builder` for building a
  `tff.templates.IterativeProcess`, as well as hyperparameters governing
  how to perform federated training using the resulting iterative process.

  We assume that the iterative process has the following functional type
  signatures:

    *   `initialize`: `( -> S@SERVER)` where `S` represents the server state.
    *   `next`: `<S@SERVER, {B*}@CLIENTS> -> <S@SERVER, T@SERVER>` where `S`
        represents the server state, `{B*}` represents the client datasets,
        and `T` represents a python `Mapping` object.

  The iterative process must also have a callable attribute `get_model_weights`
  that takes as input the state of the iterative process, and returns a
  `tff.learning.models.ModelWeights` object.

  Attributes:
    iterative_process_builder: A function that accepts a no-arg `model_fn`, and
      returns a `tff.templates.IterativeProcess`. The `model_fn` must return a
      `tff.learning.models.VariableModel`.
    fine_tune_epoch: An integer representing the number of epochs of training
      performed per client in fine-tuning.
    num_basis: An integer representing the number of bases used on clients.
    embedding_type: An string for annotating the embedding type.
    num_filters_expand: An optional int used to exapnd the number of channels as
      comparison.
    temp: temperature to apply before the Softmax of client embedding
