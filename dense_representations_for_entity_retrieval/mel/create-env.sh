# Creates a virtual environment for running get-mewsli-*.sh data extraction
# scripts.
#
# DEFAULT USAGE (ONLY VIRTUALENV): bash create-env.sh
# Creates a new *virtualenv* and only installs the required Python packages.

# ALTERNATIVE USAGE (WITH CONDA): bash create-env.sh conda
# This method assumes the system has conda installed, and creates a new conda
# environment containing all dependencies needed to run the get-mewsli-*.sh data
# extraction scripts, covering Python itself, some other tools, and the required
# Python packages.
#
# On Linux or Mac, preference is given to environment specifications that
# explicitly list direct and indirect dependencies, with specific versions that
# have been confirmed to work.
#
# For other platforms (or to use as a manual fallback), the provided .yml file
# only gives direct dependencies, with fewer version constraints, and relies
# on conda for resolution.
