"""Log-base-2 versions of special functions.

Most special functions are implemented in terms of base-e exponentials and
logarithms. However, most hardware is implemented in terms of base-2.0
exponentials and logarithms, and converting between bases requires a
multiplication. By providing base-2.0 versions of these functions, we can save
some multiplies, requiring the caller to do the compensating multiplies. Often
the caller can do so more efficiently, e.g. by folding them into nearby matrix
multiplies or rescales.
