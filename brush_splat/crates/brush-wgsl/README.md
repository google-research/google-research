This crate handles reflecting WGSL data to generate some rust structures, and handles integrating kernels with burn. It's inspired by [wgsl-bindgen](https://github.com/Swoorup/wgsl-bindgen), but is much lighter weight to use.

In the future the kernels could use [CubeCL](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl) instead of wgsl.
