In this research project, we use a learned model to guide a bottom-up program synthesis search to efficiently synthesize spreadsheet programs.

## Setup

Most of this project is written in Java. Use the `compile.sh` script to download the necessary `.jar` files and compile the code. The `clean.sh` script will remove the downloaded `.jar` files and delete compiled `.class` files that were produced by `compile.sh`.

Use the `download_sygus_benchmarks.sh` script to download SyGuS benchmark tasks.

We use Python for model training. If you want to train new models, you'll need Python and TensorFlow.

## Running the Synthesizer

The trained model is provided in the `models` directory. Use the `run_synthesis.sh` script to run synthesis using the BUSTLE model. This will output results as JSON files in a new `results` directory.

## Training a New Model

First, generate synthetic training data with the script `generate_data.sh`, which will produce a JSON file in a new `training_data` directory. Then, run the `train.sh` script, which will produce model files in the `models` directory.

## Running Tests

Run tests with `run_tests.sh`.
