  """Evaluates the semilocal exchange-correlation energy.

  This function concerns the energies, which should not be confused with other
  functions in california.xc that evaluates energy densities.

  The total exchange energy Exc of range-separated hybrid (RSH) functionals
  can be decomposed into semilocal exchange-correlation Exc_sl, exact exchange
  Exx, long-range exact exchange Exx_lr and (optionally) nonlocal correlation
  Ec_nl:
    Exc = Exc_sl + (alpha + beta) * Exx - beta * Exx_lr + Ec_nl
  Therefore, the semilocal exchange-correlation energy is given by
    Exc_sl = Exc - (alpha + beta) * Exx + beta * Exx_lr - Ec_nl
  where alpha and beta are RSH parameters that can be obtained with the
  rsh_and_hybrid_coeff function in pyscf/dft/numint.py

  Exc_sl can be further decomposed into short-range semilocal exchange Ex_sr,
  long-range semilocal exchange Ex_lr and semilocal correlation Ec_sl:
    Exc_sl = (1 - (alpha + beta)) * Ex_sr + (1 - alpha) * Ex_lr + Ec_sl
  For RSH functionals with alpha = 1 (e.g. wB97M-V), the Exc_sl only contains
  short-range semilocal exchange and semilocal correlation:
    Exc_sl = -beta * Ex_sr + Ec_sl
  Note that for functionals like wB97M-V, the factor -beta does not explicitly
  appear, instead it is implicitly included in the definition of Ex_sr.

  Args:
    alpha: Float, RSH parameter.
    beta: Float, RSH parameter.
    exc: Float, the total exchange-correlation energy Exc.
    exx: Float, the exact-exchange energy Exx.
    exx_lr: Float, the long-range exact-exchange energy Exx_lr.
    enlc: Float, the nonlocal correlation energy Ec_nl.

  Returns:
    Float, the semilocal exchange-correlation energy Exc_sl.
