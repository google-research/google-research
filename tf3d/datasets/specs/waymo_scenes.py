"""Feature specification for Waymo `scene` Dataset.

A single `scene` data describes a 3D scene  which have been constructed from
collection of individual `frame` level data. Apart from some context features
common to all frames in the scene, we also store a lightweight sequence of frame
information corresponding to all frames in the scene.
