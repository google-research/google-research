  Attributes:
    root_cell: Whether the cell is the root cell at the top left of the matrix.
    up_score: The score resulting from reaching the current token pair from
      directly above this cell, which represents a deletion of the token
      represented by the row index of the current cell.
    diag_score: The score resulting from reaching the current token pair from
      the up-left diagonal cell, which represents a pairing of the tokens
      represented by the row and column of the current cell.
    left_score: The score resulting from reaching the current token pair from
      the left, which represents an insertion of the token represented by the
      column index of the current cell.
    num_lefts: The number of consecutive lefts that must be taken to reach the
      current cell in order to produce the score stored in the 'left_score'
      attribute. For basic alignment in which insertions are treated
      identically, this will always be 1, since the cell directly to the left
      contains all the information needed. But when expansion gap scores are
      considered, and the starting position and size of the gap can result in
      different scores, a different num_lefts may result.
    diag_score_type: The type of the diag score, indicates what type of pair
      the tokens represented by the row and column of the current cell make.
    best_score: The best alignment score possible when aligning all upstream
      tokens such that there is a pairing between the tokens represented by the
      row and column of the current cell.
    best_nonleft_score: Similar to the best alignment score, except this is the
      best score that excludes inheriting from any cells directly to the left.
    best_direction_sequence: The sequence of directional steps to take through
      the alignment matrix from the current cell to reach the parent cell that
      is associated with the best alignment score for the current cell.

class NeedlemanWunschMatrix:
  """A class for aligning original abbreviated text with its expanded text.

  This implementation assumes that a lower alignment score is more optimal, and
  that the original tokens are lined up along the rows of the alignment matrix
  and the expanded tokens are lined up along the columns. The complexity of
  computing an alignment between an original token sequence of length n and a
  expanded sequence of length m is O(n*m). With the expansion_gap_score, this
  complexity increases to O(n*m^2).

  Attributes:
    tokenizer: The tokenizer used to break apart and join strings to and from
      tokens.
    orig_tokens: The tokens from the original text that potentially contain
      abbreviations.
    expanded_tokens: The tokens from the expanded text that potentially contain
      attempted expansions of each of the abbreviations contained in the
      original text.
    match_score: The score attributed to a pair of matching tokens that have
      been aligned.
    mismatch_score: The score attributed to a pair of mismatching tokens that
      have been aligned.
    indel_score: The score attributed to an insertion/deletion of a token
      between the two text sequences.
    label_abbreviation_expansions: An optional dictionary from each ground truth
      abbreviation in the original text to a sequence of the ground truth
      expansions for that abbreviation. This dictionary is used for scoring
      abbreviation expansion gaps by determining whether an Nth insertion after
      an abbreviation still falls within the expected expansion length. If an
      abbreviation maps to a single expansion, this expansion will be assumed to
      apply to all instances of the abbreviation. If it maps to multiple
      expansions, it should match the number of abbreviations in the original
      text.
    same_first_char_score: The optional score attributed to a pair of
      mismatching tokens that share a first character that have been aligned.
    expansion_gap_score: The optional score attributed to all insertions that
      fall within the expected gap of an abbreviation expansion. For instance,
      if an abbreviation is expected to have a 3-token expansion, the 1st token
      should be paired with the abbreviation and the following 2 token
      insertions represent the expansion gap and should be scored less harshly
      that a typical insertion.
