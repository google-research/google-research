  """Generates a sample containing at least n instances of each contained value.

  Examples are shuffled and then added iteratively to the sample if at least one
  contained value in the example has not already been sampled at least
  n_per_value times.

  Args:
    examples: a pd.DataFrame of examples to sample from. Must contain
      contained_values_col_name.
    contained_values_col_name: name of the column in examples indicating the
      values contained in each example. Each entry in the column should be an
      iterable over the present values.
    n_per_value: minimum number of instances of each value expected in the
      sample.
    seed: Optional seed for RNG determinism.

  Returns:
    A 2-tuple containing:
      - The sampled examples, as a pd.DataFrame
      - The total value instance counts for the sample, as a
        collections.Counter
