"""Library to extracts pairwise preferences from soft attribute data collection.

This library takes as input three-way bucketed data about soft attributes (with
items classified as about the same, more or less relative to an anchor item, see
https://github.com/google-research-datasets/soft-attributes). It processes this
data into more useful forms, using the
SoftAttributeJudgment class as the basic representation.
