## Analytic code to support "A toolbox for surfacing health equity harms and biases in large language models"

This repository contains code to reproduce the primary analyses of Pfohl and Cole-Lewis et al. "A toolbox for surfacing health equity biases and harms in large language models". Available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12025.

Before executing code in this repository, please extract the supplementary data file(s) from the links provided in the article. 

The code can be executed using either (1) the xlsx workbook linked in the article (`equitymedqa_ratings.xlsx`)
or (2) the csv files extracted from the Figshare repository
(`ratings_independent.csv`, `ratings_pairwise.csv`, and
`ratings_counterfactual.csv`) (to be made available with the published version of the article).

As of this version of the code, this repository implements the estimates of the rates and confidence intervals used to generate Figures 2, 3, and 4. Analyses reflected in Extended Data or Supplementary figures and tables are not implemented at this time.
