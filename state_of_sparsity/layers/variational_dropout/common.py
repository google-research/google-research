  This method calculates the log \alpha values based on this relation.

  Args:
    log_sigma2: tf.Variable. The log variance for each weight.
    theta: tf.Variable. The mean for each weight.
    eps: Small constant value to use in log and sqrt operations to avoid NaNs.
    value_limit: If not None, the log_alpha values will be clipped to the
     range [-value_limit, value_limit]. This is consistent with the
     implementation provided with the publication.

  Returns:
    A tf.Tensor representing the calculated log \alpha values.
