# new noise for each embedding vectors at all timesteps in the batch

# be to sample a noise vector for each token in the vocabulary, so that
# all instances of an embedding vector for a given token would be the
# same within a batch. Another alternative implementation would be to
# sample a noise vector for each token in the vocabulary for each element
# in the batch so that, within a sequence, all instances of an embedding
# vector for a given token would be the same, but across different elements
# in the batch they could be different.
#
# The first alternative implementation would add another embedding lookup
# to the implementation. We'd generate a noise tensor with shape
# [vocab_size, embedding_size], and for each token id in the batch we'd
# do an embedding lookup to get the appropriate noise vector. We'd then
# do two more embedding lookups, one to get the mean vector and one to
# get the log variance vector for the token. These 3 tensors with shape
# [batch_size, seq_length, embedding_size] would then be combined the
# same way they are in this implementation.
#
# This last implementation may not be practical, because we would have to
# sample `vocab_size * embedding_size * batch_size` random values per
# iteration. We'd also have unique noise embeddings for each element in
# the batch, meaning we'd have to do `batch_size` + 2 embedding lookups.
