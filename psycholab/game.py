  Attributes:
    ascii_art: a list of strings, representing the map of the game. Ex:
                art = ['#####',
                       '#   #',
                       '#a=A#',
                       '#####',]
                This represents a room surrounded by absolute walls ('#')
                containing one item ('a'), one player ('A') and one player
                wall ('=') that only stops players (items can pass).

    items: items is a dictionary mapping items to their names (lowercase)
            in the ascii-art ex, we would have:
            items = {Item():'a'}.

    players: a dictionary mapping players to their names (uppercase) in the
             ascii-art: players = {Player():'A'}.

    tabular: a boolean that specifies if observations are images (False)
             or integers (True).

    max_steps: an integer that represents the maximal number of steps
               before the game ends.

    actions: dictionary mapping integers (representing actions)
             to strings (textual descriptions of actions)

    last_events: list of strings describing events. Events are textual
                 descriptions of what occurs in the game.
                 The default events that can appear are:

      - 'A_moves' (when player A takes a moving action (1,2,3 or 4))
      - 'A_goes_to_the_wall' (player A is blocked by a wall)
      - 'A_is_blocked_by_X' (when player A is blocked by another player or item)
      - 'A_lost_the_drawn' (when several players try to reach the same cell,
                            one player will be picked randomly)
      - 'A_collects_x' (when player A colletcs an item)

    rewards: dictionary mapping events (strings) to rewards (floats)

    terminaisons: list of events (strings) that causes the end of the game.

    effects: dictionary mapping events (strings) with functions that
                  modifies the game's attributes.

    steps: counts the number of steps done during an episode.

    done: boolean specifying if the game has ended.

    height: vertical dimensions of the game map.

    width: horizontal dimensions of the game map.

    players_cells: dictionary mapping players names to their
                       (x,y) positions in the game.

    players_items: dictionary mapping players names to dictionaries mapping
                       item names to integers, representing the quantity
                       of each item collected by each player.

    items_cells: dictionary mapping items names to their
                      (x,y) positions in the game.

    player_walls: dictionary mapping player walls to their (x,y) positions.

    absolute_walls: dictionary mapping absolute walls
                    to their (x,y) positions.

    content: 2d table of dictionaries mapping elements
                  (player or items names) to integers (their quantities)
                  at each (x,y) position.

    players_order: sorted list of players names,
                   used to attribute indexes (intergers) to players.

    items_order: sorted list of items names,
                 used to attribute indexes (interger) to items.

    players_idx: dictionary mapping players names to players indexes (int).

    items_idx: dictionary mapping items names to their indexes (int).

    num_players: number of players.

    num_items: number of items.

    num_actions: number of actions for each player.

    num_states: number of states (upper bound of the number
                of combinations of players positions).

    action_space: gym-like action space (a MultiDiscrete space).
