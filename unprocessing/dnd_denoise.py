"""Unprocessing evaluation on the Darmstadt Noise Dataset.

Unprocessing Images for Learned Raw Denoising
http://timothybrooks.com/tech/unprocessing

This file denoises images from the Darmstadt Noise Dataset using the
unprocessing neural networks. The full Darmstadt code and data should be
downloaded from https://noise.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/downloads and this file
should replace the dnd_denoise.py file that is provided.

This file is modified from the original version by Tobias Plotz, TU Darmstadt
(tobias.ploetz@visinf.tu-darmstadt.de), and is part of the implementation as
described in the CVPR 2017 paper: Benchmarking Denoising Algorithms with Real
Photographs, Tobias Plotz and Stefan Roth. Modified by Tim Brooks of Google in
2019. The original license is below.
