# Accurate Prediction of Experimental Band Gaps from Large Language Model-Based Data Extraction

Our paper demonstrates that databases created from LLM-assisted, prompt-based
extraction achieves state-of-the-art performance on predicting experimentally
measured properties using band gap as an example.

This repository contains prompts used in the paper to extract band gaps
from literature. It also contains a notebook that demonstrates how LLMs
can be further prompted to train a band gap prediction model from the
extracted data.
