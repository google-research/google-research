  """Encourages keypoint to have different temporal trajectories.

  If two keypoints move along trajectories that are identical up to a time-
  invariant translation (offset), this suggest that they both represent the same
  object and are redundant, which we want to avoid.

  To measure this similarity of trajectories, we first center each trajectory by
  subtracting its mean. Then, we compute the pairwise distance between all
  trajectories at each timepoint. These distances are higher for trajectories
  that are less similar. To compute the loss, the distances are transformed by
  a Gaussian and averaged across time and across trajectories.

  Args:
    cfg: ConfigDict.
    coords: [batch, time, num_landmarks, 3] coordinate tensor.

  Returns:
    Separation loss.
