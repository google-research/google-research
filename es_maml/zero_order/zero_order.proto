/* Proto defining the format of messages exchanged by the client and servers.

EvaluationRequest: sent by the client to servers. Client communicates current
                   input for the blackbox function as a base vector around which
                   servers/workers will conduct perturbations to evaluate
                   blackbox function in the neighborhood of a base vector.

EvaluationResponse: sent by servers to the client. Each server is sending the
                    list of chosen perturbation directions and the corresponding
                    list of function values (function is evaluated at a base
                    vector perturbed by the perturbation vectors).

The Vanilla versions are for debugging, without perturbations.
