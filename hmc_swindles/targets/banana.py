  """Creates a banana-shaped distribution.

  This distribution was first described in [1]. The distribution is constructed
  by transforming a N-D gaussian with scale [10, 1, ...] by shifting the second
  dimension by `nonlinearity * (x0 - 100)` where `x0` is the value of the first
  dimension.

  This distribution is notable for having relatively narrow tails, while being
  derived from a simple, volume-preserving transformation of a normal
  distribution. Despite this simplicity, some inference algorithms have trouble
  sampling from this distribution.

  Args:
    ndims: Dimensionality of the distribution. Must be at least 2.
    nonlinearity: Controls the strength of the nonlinearity of the distribution.
    name: Name to prepend to ops created in this function, as well as to the
      `code_name` in the returned `TargetDensity`.

  Returns:
    target: `TargetDensity` specifying the banana distribution. The
      `distribution` attribute is an instance of `TransformedDistribution`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If ndims < 2.
