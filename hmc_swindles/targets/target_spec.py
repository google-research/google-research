  """Describes an expectation with respect to a specific target's samples.

  Specifically, `E_{x~p}[f(x)]` for a target `p` and function `f`.  The target
  `p` is implicit, in that the `Expectation` appears in the `expectations` field
  of that `TargetDensity`.  The `f` is given as `fn` so that candidate
  samples may be passed through it.  The `fn` may close over the
  parameters of `p`, and the `ground_truth_mean` will presumably depend on `p`
  implicitly via some sampling process.

  If the `ground_truth_mean` is estimated by sampling, then
  `ground_truth_standard_deviation` and `ground_truth_mean_standard_error` are
  related using the standard formula:
  ```none
  SEM = SD / sqrt(N)
  ```
  where `N` is the number of samples. `ground_truth_standard_deviation`
  describes the distribution of `f(x)`, while `ground_truth_mean_standard_error`
  desribes how accurately we know `ground_truth_mean`.

  Attributes:
    fn: Function that takes samples from the target and returns
      a `Tensor`. The returned `Tensor` must retain the leading non-event
      dimensions.
    human_name: Human readable name, suitable for a table in a paper.
    ground_truth_mean: Ground truth value of this expectation. Can be `None` if
      not available.
    ground_truth_mean_standard_error: Standard error of the ground truth. Can be
      `None` if not available.
    ground_truth_standard_deviation: Standard deviation of samples transformed
      by `fn`. Can be `None` if not available.

  #### Examples

  An identity `fn` for a vector-valued target would look like:

  ```python
  fn = lambda x: x
  ```

  If the target is over a tuple-shaped space, then you could opt to return a
  particular element:

  ```python
  fn = lambda x: x[0]
  ```

  or concatenate all the elements (assuming they're vectors):

  ```python
  fn = lambda x: tf.concatenate(x, axis=-1)
  ```
