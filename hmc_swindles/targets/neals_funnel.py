  """Creates a funnel-shaped distribution.

  This distribution was first described in [1]. The distribution is constructed
  by transforming a N-D gaussian with scale [3, 1, ...] by scaling all but the
  first dimensions by `exp(x0 / 2)` where  `x0` is the value of the first
  dimension.

  This distribution is notable for having a relatively very narrow "neck" region
  which is challenging for HMC to explore. This distribution resembles the
  posteriors of centrally parameterized hierarchical models.

  Args:
    ndims: Dimensionality of the distribution. Must be at least 2.
    name: Name to prepend to ops created in this function, as well as to the
      `code_name` in the returned `TargetDensity`.

  Returns:
    target: `TargetDensity` specifying the funnel distribution. The
      `distribution` attribute is an instance of `TransformedDistribution`.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If ndims < 2.
