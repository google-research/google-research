"""Implements 1D cubic Hermite spline interpolation."""

def interpolate1d(x, values, tangents):
  r"""Perform cubic hermite spline interpolation on a 1D spline.

  The x coordinates of the spline knots are at [0 : len(values)-1].
  Queries outside of the range of the spline are computed using linear
  extrapolation. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_Hermite_spline
  for details, where "x" corresponds to `x`, "p" corresponds to `values`, and
  "m" corresponds to `tangents`.

  Args:
    x: A tensor containing the set of values to be used for interpolation into
      the spline.
    values: A vector containing the value of each knot of the spline being
      interpolated into. Must be the same length as `tangents`.
    tangents: A vector containing the tangent (derivative) of each knot of the
      spline being interpolated into. Must be the same length as `values` and
      the same type as `x`.

  Returns:
    The result of interpolating along the spline defined by `values`, and
    `tangents`, using `x` as the query values. Will be the same shape as `x`.
