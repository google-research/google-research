"""This file is adapted from "imagesegmentation.py" in the github repo

"image-segmentation".

A great portion of the functions are reused from the original file, while the
others are changed or re-implemented to work in our problem framework.

The functions used to:
    - resize the input image
    - collect manually selected seeds and store them for later use on image
    sequences
    - construct the graph based on the given seeds and other parameters
    - perform imagesegmentation on an image by calling the other funcs above and
    the ford-fulkerson subroutine from augmentingPath.py
One can run this file on a chosen image to choose a set of seeds, and then apply
those seeds to the whole sequence.

These matrices will be read during warm-start and the seeds will be applied to all images from the same sequence.
