"""This file implements the cold-start FF algorithm with shortest augmenting path.

The augmenting path is found by running BFS each time. After FF terminates,
DFS is then used to find the cuts.
This file is adapted from "augmentingPath.py" in the github repo
"image-segmentation".
The functions in this file are re-implemented from the functions with the same
name from the original file.

"""
Re-implemented from bfs() in the original "augmentingPath.py" but slightly changed to adapt to the data type of some_graph.
In the original implementation the input graph is a matrix. However this does not take advantage of the sparsity of the graph.
We reimplemented the algorithm and made the input graph a dictionary of {node:adjacency list} instead,
where each adjacency list is another default dictionary of {neighbor: arc capacity on (node, neighbor)}.

Similar to augmentingPath() in the original "augmentingPath.py" with changes.
flow_value and rGraph: can potentially be used to warmstart.
    - If None, flows is initialized to be all 0's on the arcs, and rGraph is equivalent to the capacities on each arc.
    - Otherwises, start finding augmenting paths and increase the flow based on the given flow and rGraph.
Must be feasible, satisfying both capacity and flow conservation constraints.
If None, it means start from scratch.
