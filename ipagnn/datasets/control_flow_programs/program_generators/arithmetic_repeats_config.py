  Attributes:
    base: The base to represent the integers in.
    length: The number of statements in the generated programs.
    num_digits: The number of digits in the values used by the programs.
    max_repeat_statements: The maximum number of repeat statements allowed in
      a program.
    max_repetitions: The maximum number of repetitions a repeat statement may
      specify.
    max_repeat_block_size: The maximum number of statements permitted in a
      repeat block.
    repeat_probability: The probability that a given statement is a repeat
      statement, provided a repeat statement is possible at that location.
    permit_nested_repeats: Whether or not nested repeat statements are
      permitted.
    ops: The ops allowed in the generated programs.
    encoder_name: The encoder name to use to encode the generated programs.
    mod: The value (if any) to mod the intermediate values of the program by
      after each step of execution.
    output_mod: The value (if any) to mod the final values of the program by.
    start_with_initialization: If true, the program's first line is v0 = _.
