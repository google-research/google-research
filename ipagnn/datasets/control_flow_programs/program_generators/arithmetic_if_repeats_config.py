  """Config for ArithmeticIfRepeats ProgramGenerator.

  Attributes:
    base: The base to represent the integers in.
    length: The number of statements in the generated programs.
    num_digits: The number of digits in the values used by the programs.
    max_repeat_statements: The maximum number of repeat statements allowed in
      a program.
    max_repetitions: The maximum number of repetitions a repeat statement may
      specify.
    repeat_probability: The probability that a given statement is a repeat
      statement, provided a repeat statement is possible at that location.
    max_if_statements: The maximum number of if statements allowed in a program.
    if_probability: The probability that a given statement is an if statement,
      provided an if statement is possible at that location.
    ifelse_probability: The probability that a given statement is an if-else
      statement, provided an if statement is possible at that location.
    max_nesting: The maximum depth of nesting permitted, or None if no limit.
    max_block_size: The maximum number of statements permitted in a block.
    ops: The ops allowed in the generated programs.
    encoder_name: The encoder name to use to encode the generated programs.
    mod: The value (if any) to mod the intermediate values of the program by
      after each step of execution.
    output_mod: The value (if any) to mod the final values of the program by.
