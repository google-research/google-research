"""Helper classes for processing sparse data through the full data pipeline.

There are many cases where we want to maintain sparse mappings. Some examples:
- Mappings of nodes to graphs.
- Mappings of nodes to per-graph candidate groups.
- Mappings of output targets to input nodes that the output could have been
  copied from.
- Mapping of source nodes to dest nodes for message passing or attention.

For each of these mappings, we need a common set of operations:
- Create representations of the mappings to store in tf.Examples.
- Dynamically batch together multiple mappings.
- Render the mapping out in a convenient form for the TensorFlow operations that
  use the mapping to implement some function of interest.

The classes in this module are meant to encapsulate all of this functionality,
so that all the logic for processing the data is in one place, and to make it
easier to have problems with many sparse mappings.

--------------------
Creating tf.Examples
--------------------

At tf.Example creation time, we need to create these relations. For graph
problems, this would happen in the implementation of
_add_{graph,target}_features in /l/b/r/ps/toolkit/graph_problem.GraphInstance.
Example code might look like the following:

  def _add_graph_features(self, features):
    out_to_in_pairs = ...   # Problem-specific way of getting out-to-in pairs.
    shepherd = SparseTensorShepherd("out_to_in")
    features.update(shepherd.tf_example_features(out_to_in_pairs, dense_shape))


--------------------
Loading tf.Examples
--------------------

Next we'll need to load the data using the tf.data.Dataset API. For this, we
need metadata about the set and types of features that were added to the
tf.Example. This is implemented in `feature_descriptions`. We can then call

  tf.parse_single_example(serialized_example, shepherd.feature_loading_spec()))

to get back a dictionary of tensors from the tf.Examples.


----------------
Dynamic batching
----------------

We want to batch by adding as many graphs as we can to a batch until we hit
a maximum number of nodes or edges. We want this to be done in Tensorflow so
that it can be used in a tf.data pipeline, and  don't want to have to write this
logic separately for every combination of sparse mappings that we might want to
use in a model. See the `batching_loop_*` methods in this class and the
tf.while_loop in sparse_shepherds_test.py::test_dynamic_batching for a design
that let's us write a generic tf.while_loop for the dynamic batching while
plugging in whatever shepherd-specific logic we need for batching together the
sparse mappings.

The basic idea is that the shepherd takes ownership of a subset of loop vars
in the batching tf.while_loop, and it's also allowed to see tensors describing
the current instance. It then updates its loop vars in response. In this way,
several shepherds can update their state within a single loop without having to
change the Tensorflow code. See `test_dynamic_batching`.


-------------------
Using in TensorFlow
-------------------

Finally, after the data has been loaded, batched, and written to the batched
tensors dict, we can ask the shepherd for a sparse tensor representation of the
batched mapping using `get_tensor`.
