):
  """Generate samples from a discrete power-law distribution.

  Generates n_samples many samples in [x_min, x_max] range from a discrete
  power-law distribution, per the method outlined in (D.6) of the paper [1].
  However, that method only supports x_min and not x_max. To incorporate x_max
  support, we utilize the following equation:
  `floor( (x_min - 0.5) * (1 - r) ** (-1 / (a - 1)) + 0.5) <= x_max`
  To solve for 'r' in this equation, follow these steps:
  1. Move the floor function to the right side of the inequality:
  ```
  (x_min - 0.5) * (1 - r) ** (-1 / (a - 1)) + 0.5 < floor(x_max +1)
  ```
  2. Isolate the exponential term by subtracting 0.5 from both sides:
   ```
   (x_min - 0.5) * (1 - r) ** (-1 / (a - 1)) < floor(x_max +1) - 0.5
   ```
  3. Simplify the inequality by letting 'y = floor(x_max + 1) - 0.5':
   ```
   (x_min - 0.5) * (1 - r) ** (-1 / (a - 1)) < y
   ```
  4. Raise both sides of the inequality to the power of '-a + 1'.
  Since '-a + 1' is negative (a is >1) inequality's direction changes:
   ```
   (1 - r) > (y / (x_min - 0.5)) ** (-a + 1)
   ```
  5. Since both sides are positive, we can take the reciprocal without
  changing the inequality's direction:
   ```
   r < 1 - (y / (x_min - 0.5)) ** (-a + 1)
   ```
  6. Therefore, the solution for 'r' is:
   ```
   r < 1 - ( (floor(x_max +1) - 0.5) / (x_min - 0.5)) ** (-a + 1)
   ```
