"""Rendering from the baked representation.

This serves to verify that their is only a minimal discrepancy between rendering
from the model used during training and the style of rendering employed by the
webviewer. The main difference between real-time rendering and training-style
rendering is the employed sampling scheme. During training we use hierarchical
sampling while during rendering we use uniform sampling with empty space
skipping.
