This repository exists to provide a record of published work, and so we do not
expect to receive lots of pull-requests and do not currently have infrastructure
to support these.

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
