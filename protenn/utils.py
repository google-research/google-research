  a choice:
  1. keep these labels (because they each provide valuable information)
  2. pick one label that's most likely to be correct

  If the labels are known to be part of nested domains, we keep them.

  Else,
  A. if two labels are part of the same clan, solve the following optimization
     problem in the set of labels within each clan, such that:
     - no pair has overlaps >=50% of residues (midpoint overlap)
     - we prefer Pfam family accessions to clan accessions.
     - the sum of the lengths is the longest.

  B. if two labels are not part of the same clan, solve the same optimization
     problem, except we no longer prefer family labels to clan labels.

  This implementation is a greedy, approximate solution to the optimization
  problem.

  Args:
    flat_labels: List (label, (start, end)).
    known_nested_domains: Set (label1, label2). Assumed that both orders of
      label1, label2 are members of this set.
    family_to_clan: Mapping from label to clan. Lifted clan semantics assumed.

  Returns:
    List (label, (start, end)).

    Whenever there is midpoint overlap between two labels, choose the longer
    one. If they are the same length, prefer the one with the smaller Pfam
    family accession.
