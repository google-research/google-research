  """A node of a MCTS search tree.

    An MCTSNode stores the state representation in an OpenAI gym-like
      environment. A node can take an action in the environment using
      self.env.step.

      A node knows how to compute the action scores of all of its children,
      so that a decision can be made about which move to explore next. Upon
      selecting a move, a new MCTS node is added to the children dictionary.

    Attributes:
      state: The states of the environment that this node represent.
      max_num_actions: Maximum number of actions per each node.
      current_reward: The reward value from parent node to current node.
      move: A move (action index) that led to this state.
      parent: A parent MCTSNode.
      is_expanded: If True, this node is expanded (the children are evaluated).
      losses_applied: Use for virtual loss calculation. If True, the virtual
        loss is applied to this node.
      mask: An array indicating which actions are feasible
            (1: feasible, 0: invalid). If None, all the actions are feasible. If
              an array is given, the element of the array indicates which
              actions are feasible. Suppose the max_num_actions are 4. Then,
              mask = [2, 3] means second and third actions are feasible and
              zeroth and first actions are invalid.
      illegal_moves: An array indicating the illegal moves from the current
        node.
      child_n: An array indicating number of times each children is visited.
      child_w: An array indicating the state value for each children.
      child_reward: An array indicating the reward from current node to each of
        its children.
      original_prior: An array indicating the original probability for each
        children.
      child_prior: An array indicating the current probability for each children
        (after zeroing out the illegal moves).
      children: A dictionary with key representing the move and the value
        referencing the children MCTSNode.
      network_value: the value network result for the current node.
      done: Indicating whether this is a terminal node.

    The support of Dirichlet (i.e., the values where it is defined) is
    the set of vectors (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) whose coordinates are nonnegative
    and sum to 1. If n=3, then some examples would be (0.1, 0.5, 0.4) and
    (0.3, 0, 0.7). This set is also called the (n-dimensional) simplex.

    Now note that Dir(1) is uniform. This means that sampling from it will
    produce either of the above two vectors (or any other valid vector)
    with equal chance. As `alpha` gets smaller, Dirichlet starts to
    prefer vectors near the basis vectors: (0.98, 0.01, 0.01) or (0.1, 0.9, 0)
    will be more likely to be drawn than (0.3, 0.3, 0.4).
    For values greater than 1, the opposite is true - the basis vectors
    are de-emphasized, and more-balanced vectors are preferred.

    (1) When `alpha` > 1, this tends to `flatten` p, making us
    less strongly prefer any one move.
    (2) For `alpha` < 1, it will cause a random component to become more
    emphasized.

    In both cases, MCTSPlayer is encourged to explore AWAY from the prior.

    It is suggested to choose `alpha` = 10 / (number of moves).
    However, in general `alpha` = 1 seems a reasonable value.
