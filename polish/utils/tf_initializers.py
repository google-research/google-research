  Adopted from OpenAI implementation:
  https://github.com/openai/baselines/blob/master/baselines/a2c/utils.py

  This implementation is simpler than the TF implementation. In order to prevent
  bringing any uncertainity into the program, we decided to use this
  initializer. Later, we can test our implementation with
  tf.keras.initializers.Orthogonal and deprecate this implementation.

  Attributes:
    _scale: Used to scale the initializer value.
