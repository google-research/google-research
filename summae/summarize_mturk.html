        <short-summary>
            <p>Summarize the story with one sentence.</p>
        </short-summary>

        <detailed-instructions>
            <h3>Summarize the story with one sentence.</h3>
            <p>
              Read the story, and write a single sentence that summarizes
              the story. The writing level and style should be comparable to
              the story. Use proper grammar, punctuation, and capitalization.
              
              The summary should be significantly shorter than the story. Do not try to retain every detail of the story in a very long (or run-on) sentence and prefer simple sentences.
              Avoid copying/pasting large segments of the story.
        </p>
