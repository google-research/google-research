"""A simple invertible tokenizer.

This code forked from github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor.

Converts from a unicode string to a list of tokens
(represented as Unicode strings).

This tokenizer has the following desirable properties:
 - It is invertible.
 - Alphanumeric characters are broken away from non-alphanumeric characters.
 - A single space between words does not produce an extra token.
 - The full Unicode punctuation and separator set is recognized.

The tokenization algorithm is as follows:

1.  Split the text into a list of tokens, splitting at every boundary of an
    alphanumeric character and a non-alphanumeric character.  This produces
    a list which alternates between "alphanumeric tokens"
    (strings of alphanumeric characters) and "non-alphanumeric tokens"
    (strings of non-alphanumeric characters).

2.  Remove every token consisting of a single space, unless it is
    the very first or very last token in the list.  These tokens are now
    implied by the fact that there are two adjacent alphanumeric tokens.

e.g.  u"Dude - that's so cool."
        -> [u"Dude", u" - ", u"that", u"'", u"s", u"so", u"cool", u"."]
