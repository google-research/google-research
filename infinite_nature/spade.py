def diff_resize_area(tensor, new_height_width):
  """Performs a resize op that passes gradients evenly.

  The tensor goes through a resize and pool where the resize and pool
  operations are determined by the Least Common Multiplier. Since resize with
  nearest_neighbors and avg_pool distributes the gradients from the
  output to input evenly, there's less of a chance of learning artifacts. First
  we resize to the LCM then avg_pool to new_height_width. This resize operation
  is only efficient in cases where LCM is small. This is typically the case when
  upsampling or downsampling by a factor of 2 (e.g H = 0.5 * new_H).

  Args:
    tensor: a tensor of shape [B, H, W, D]
    new_height_width: A tuple of length two which specifies new height, width
      respectively.

  Returns:
    The resize area tensor [B, H_new, W_new, D].

  Raises:
    RuntimeError: If the LCM is larger than 10 x new_height_width, then
      raise an error to prevent inefficient memory usage.
