  It would be interesting to explore factor analysis because it is a natural way
  to extract important latent features from the data, and PCA is actually a
  special case of factor analysis. When the variances of the error term in
  factor analysis are identical and go towards zero, the posterior estimate of
  the latent variables becomes exactly PCA.

  TVN is essentially PCA without dimension reduction. Compared with TVN, the
  drawback of factor analysis is that it requires to specify the number of
  latent variables. As an ad-hoc approach, I would suggest specifying it as the
  number of unique treatments.

  Args:
    embedding_dataframe: Pandas dataframe of the embeddings with each row as a
      sample.
    fraction: Fraction of negative control samples used to estimate parameters
      in factor analysis.

  This function is adapted from @geoffd's colab:
  https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-umIy5UPrYIVWJYYnZaMzNRNGc.

  The main idea of CORAL method is (1) finding an affine transformation on each
  batch (or plate) such that after transformation the covariances of the
  negative control on each batch (or plate) are the same as the overall
  covariance of the negative control before transformation; (2) applying each
  learned transformation to all compounds on each batch (or plate).

      mean of those of the negative control on each batch (or plate)
