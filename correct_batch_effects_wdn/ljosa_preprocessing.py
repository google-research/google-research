"""Pre-processing step for Ljosa embeddings.

The goal is to replicate the work done in the Ljosa paper
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3884769/), within our framework so
we can try the WDN method on them (i.e. the Wasserstein Distance Network method
for batch correction).

There are two steps: The first is to normalize the components between the 1st
and 99th percentile of the controls. The second step is factor analysis with
50 dimesions.

The input is an H5 dataframe with 462 embedding dimensions. The output should
be two embeddings dataframes, after each step of the analysis. The first
dataframe has 456 components, since some dimensions are dropped (when the
normalization is not successful). The post-factor analysis embedding has
50 dimensions because this is the number of factors used.

The methods here could also be used as post-processing after e.g. the WDN
method.
