"""Implementation of DataSource objecy to generate training data.

The ClassroomGroupedDatasource datasource generates datapoints by sampling
sequences of multiple students within a classroom then composing them to make
a single datapoint. The ClassroomGroupedDatasource provides sampling with
and without replacement. The without replacement sampler can be used for doing
a single exhuastive pass over a dataset for evaluation.
