The code is written in Python and requires specific packages, which can be installed via pip. It has been tested on Linux, and can run either on GPU or CPU depending on the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment variable. The authors provide a minimal example for running the code and ask to cite their paper when using this implementation.",
