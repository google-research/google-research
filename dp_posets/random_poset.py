"""Functions for random poset experiments.

This module introduces a sampler to uniformly sample a random DAG on a fixed
number of uniquely labeled nodes. This is based on the following paper:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1571065304003944. It also
includes functions for running and plotting relevant experiments.
