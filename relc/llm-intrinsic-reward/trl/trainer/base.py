class BaseTrainer(PyTorchModelHubMixin):
    r"""
    Base class for all trainers - this base class implements the basic functions that we
    need for a trainer.

    The trainer needs to have the following functions:
        - step: takes in a batch of data and performs a step of training
        - loss: takes in a batch of data and returns the loss
        - compute_rewards: takes in a batch of data and returns the rewards
        - _build_models_and_tokenizer: builds the models and tokenizer
        - _build_dataset: builds the dataset
    Each user is expected to implement their own trainer class that inherits from this base
    if they want to use a new training algorithm.
