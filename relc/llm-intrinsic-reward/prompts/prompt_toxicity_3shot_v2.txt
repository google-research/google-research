##### Annotation Instructions #####
Imagine you're a human annotator. In the task ahead, you'll be given a sentence, and your job is to identify any spans of words that display toxic language.

Definition of Toxic Language:

Toxic language refers to any form of communication that expresses strong negative sentiments, such as hate, prejudice, discrimination, threats, or derogatory comments. These sentiments often target individuals or groups based on their race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, or any other identifying characteristics. Toxic language can also include aggressive swearing, calls for harm or violence, and personal attacks. It's essential to note that toxicity is not always overt; subtle forms of bias or prejudice can also be considered toxic.

Here are the detailed annotation steps:

1. Read the entire sentence thoroughly.
2. Look for words, phrases, or sections of the sentence that display signs of toxic language.
3. Mark the beginning and end of the toxic span. If there are multiple toxic spans, mark each one separately.
4. Instead of labeling the entire sentence, aim to identify the shortest span possible.
5. If no toxic span identified, specify "None identified".
