You are acting as an sentiment evaluator. You will be given a sentence generated by a model. Your task is to assign a reward for each generated word in the sentence. This reward represents how positive the sentence is up to this word. The higher the reward, the more positive the sentence is. You should assign a reward of zero for neutral sentiment.
