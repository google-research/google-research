methods: "This model employs a two-level stacking ensemble for probabilistic quantile forecasting. Level-0 integrates three heuristic time series models: one for seasonality and momentum, another for smoothed trend and persistence, and a third for local epidemiological growth with spatial influences, utilizing Ridge regression and generating Negative Binomial forecasts. These are then combined through horizon-dependent weighted averages, further enhanced by data augmentation converting historical ILI into synthetic hospital admissions using per-location Ridge regression to expand the training context."
