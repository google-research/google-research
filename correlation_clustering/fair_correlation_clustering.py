r"""Implementation of the Fair Correlation Clustering AISTATS2020 Paper.

===============================

This is the implementation accompanying the AISTATS 2020 paper,
[_Fair Correlation Clustering_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02274).


Citing
------
If you find _Fair Correlation Clustering_ useful in your research, we ask that
you cite the following paper:

> Ahmadian, S., Epasto, A., Mahdian, M., Kumar, R. (2020).
> Fair Correlation Clustering.
> In _AISTATS_.

    @inproceedings{ahmadian2020fair,
     author={Ahmadian, Epasto, Mahdian, Kumar}
     title={Fair Correlation Clustering},
     booktitle = {AISTATS},
     year = {2020},
    }

Example execution
------
python3 -m fair_correlation_clustering.correlation_clustering \
  --input_graph=${graph} \
  --input_color_mapping=${color_mapping} \
  --output_results=${results}

Where ${graph} is the path to a text file containing the graph,
${color_mapping} is the path to the color mapping and ${results} is the path
to the output file with the results.


As in fair clustering problems nodes are labeled with a color. We assume colors
to be intergers from 0 to c-1, for c number of colors. The node ids must be
consecutive integers in 0 ... n-1.

The input of the color mapping is a file where for each node there is row with
id color
e.g.
0 0
1 1
2 2
3 2
represents that node 0 has color 0, node 1 has color 1 and node 2 has color 2
and 3 has color 2. All nodes must have one color associated.


In this library, we assume that the graph is a _complete_ unweighted signed
graph.
That means that between each pair of nodes there is an edge which is either
positive or negative.
In the input we represent the graph by listing the positive edges only,
with the assumption that all missing edges are negative.
The graph input format is a text file containing one (positive)
edge per row represented as its pair of node ids. The graph is supposed to
be undirected. The node ids must be consecutive integers in 0 ... n-1.
For instance the file:
0 1
1 2
2 0
represents the positive triangle 0, 1, 2 and contains the implicit negative
edges 0 3, 1 3, 2 3  (since the graph has 4 nodes).

Notice that as we assume that the graph is complete, the code not optimized for
sparse graphs and it uses n^2 memory to store explictly all positive and
negative edges.

The output results format is a json file containing a pandas dataframe with the
results of the experiment.
