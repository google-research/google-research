This is a web app that loads a translation quality evaluation data file from
human evals (with Multidimensional Quality Metrics, or MQM) and automated evals
provides various aggregate scores as well as interactive analysis. The interface
allows the user to slice and dice the data by applying various filters and to
compare different translation systems. One or more data files can be loaded by
using the "Choose file(s)" button, replacing or augmenting any previously loaded
data.

To use this, you need to serve just the file marot-lite.html (either from
a web server, or just locally using file:// URLs).

This web app can be optionally invoked with a "dataurls" parameter, whose value
is a set of comma-separated URLs for data files. The URLs should be on the same
host as marot itself, or should be fetch()able via Cross-Origin Resource
Sharing (CORS).

The data files should have tab-separated UTF-8-encoded data. You can find its
format details in the README.md file.

An optional header line in the first data file will be ignored (identified by
the presence of the text "system\tdoc").

Example human eval data files and details on score computations can be found
here: https://github.com/google/wmt-mqm-human-evaluation
