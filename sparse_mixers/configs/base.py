class DispatchAlgorithm(enum.Enum):

  MASK_* dispatch algorithms use masked matmuls to dispatch and combine expert
  inputs/outputs, whereas SCATTER_* algorithms use scatter and gather to
  dispatch and combine expert inputs/outputs. MASK_* algorithms are generally
  faster on TPU, while SCATTER_* algorithms are faster on GPU and CPU.

  Possible options:
    MASK_TOKENS_CHOOSE: Tokens choose their top-k experts. Items are routed to
      their choice of expert until the expert's capacity is reached. There is no
      guarantee that each token is processed by an expert, or that each expert
      receives at least one token. This common routing algorithm is used
      in Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06538),
      Vision MoE (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05974), Switch Transformer
      (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961), Designing Effective Sparse Expert
      Models (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08906) and many others.
    MASK_EXPERTS_CHOOSE: Experts choose their top tokens. Each expert selects
      its top EXPERT_CAPACITY tokens. A given token may be processed by multiple
      experts or none at all. "Experts choose" routing should generally not be
      used in decoder blocks because it breaks the autoregressive behavior --
      the model may learn to cheat by relying on future token information to
      improve current token predictions. This router was introduced in
      Mixture-of-Experts with Expert Choice (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09368).
    SCATTER_TOKENS_CHOOSE: Same as MASK_TOKENS_CHOOSE, except that dispatch and
      combine logic uses scatters and gathers instead of matmuls.
