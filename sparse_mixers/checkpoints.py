    sharded_match_fn: Function that returns true if a given parameter name

      is given, all parameters are treated as replicated parameters.
    step: Training step number.
    keep: Number of past checkpoint files to keep.

      uses jax.process_index().
    process_count: Total number of processes in the system. If None (default),
