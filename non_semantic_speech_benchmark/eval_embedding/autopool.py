  This layer automatically adapts the pooling behavior to interpolate

      alpha_init: (Int) The value to initialize alpha to.
      trainable: (Boolean) Whether `alpha` is trainable.

    From the paper: For example, when `alpha` = 0, eq. (8) reduces to an
    unweighted mean; when `alpha` = 1,it simplifies to soft-max pooling; and
    when `alpha` -> inf, it approaches the max operator.
