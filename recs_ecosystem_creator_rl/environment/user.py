"""User model in the ecosystem.

The user model consists of user state representation, a user sampler, user
state transition model, and user response model.
  - user state representation: includes both observable and unobservable user
      features.
  - user sampler: sample a user.
  - user state transition model: describes the dynamics of user state
      transition after receiving recommendations from the agent.
  - user response model: characterizes how the user responds to the recommended
      slate, e.g document choice and engagement/satisfaction level with it.
