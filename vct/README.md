## Abstract

We show how transformers can be used to vastly simplify neural video
compression. Previous methods have been relying on an increasing number of
architectural biases and priors, including motion prediction and warping
operations, resulting in complex models. Instead, we independently map input
frames to representations and use a transformer to model their dependencies,
letting it predict the distribution of future representations given the past.
The resulting video compression transformer outperforms previous methods on
standard video compression data sets. Experiments on synthetic data show that
our model learns to handle complex motion patterns such as panning, blurring and
fading purely from data. Our approach is easy to implement, and we release code
to facilitate future research.


## Code

The code shows how each component is constructed. We are currently not
providing a `trainer` but there is a `train_step` function in `models.py`.
See `models_test.py` for an example of how to use the model to train and
evaluate.

We verified that the code outperforms the model in the paper when trained from
scratch, see App. A.2 in the [PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07307).

#### Using the code

```sh
python3 -m venv vct_env && source ./vct_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m vct.src.models_test
```

This should not throw any errors (but might print some warnings from the
restore ops).


#### Structure

- `auxiliary_layers.py`: Transformer layers
- `bottlenecks.py`: Bottleneck to calculate entropy and do range coding.
- `elic.py`: Encoder/Decoder, see App. A.2.
- `entropy_model.py`: The actual VCT Transformer.
- `extract_patches.py`: Extracting overlapping/non-overlapping patches.
- `metric_collection.py`: Helper to collect metrics.
- `models.py`: The main model file that glues all the components together
- `patcher.py`: Extract patches.
- `schedule.py`: Helper for LR schedules.
- `tf_memoize.py`: Helper for doing efficient training by caching encode steps.
- `transformer_layers.py`: Underlying transformer layers.
- `video_tensors.py`: Video tensor types.


## Synthetic Dataset

We release the code to compare on the synthetic datasets we used in the paper
in `synth/`.

#### Prepare

To use the synthetic data (see Sec. 4.1), you first have to download CLIC and
prepare it:

```bash
source ./vct_env/bin/activate  # See above
python3 synth/synthetic_data.py --clic_png_dir /path/to/some/folder --create
```

#### Use the data to eval your model

Assuming you stored the data at `/path/to/some/folder` as shown above, you can
then use it as follows:

```python
import synthetic_data

fade_ds = synthetic_data.FadeDataset(x=0.1, clic_png_dir="/path/to/some/folder")

model = ... # Load your model
for video in fade_ds.iter_videos():
  metrics = model.evaluate(video)
  ...

# We also export the values we used for Fig. 5 in VCT_DATASETS, see
# synthetic_data.py
for synth_ds in synthetic_data.all_vct_datasets():
  for video in synth_ds.iter_videos():
    ...
```

To visualize, you can also just run the script from the terminal using `--show`, for example:

```bash
source ./vct_env/bin/activate  # See above
python3 synth/synthetic_data.py --show FadeDataset -x 0.2 --video_idx 10
```
