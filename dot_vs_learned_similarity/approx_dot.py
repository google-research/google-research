  """Generates a data set where ground truth is a dot product with noise.

  Each generated training case x is a real valued vector of dimension
  2*embedding_dim (this is the concatenation of the two embedding vectors for
  which we want to learn the similarity) and a label y that encodes the
  similarity.

  The data is generated such that a perfect model (the dot product) will have an
  RMSE of rmse_best. The naive model that predicts always 0 will have an RMSE of
  rmse_naive. See the paper for more details.

  Args:
    emb_dim: the embedding dimension.
    num_users: the total number of users.
    num_items: the total number of items.
    num_train_samples: the size of the training set.
    num_test_samples: the size of the first test set.
    num_fresh_samples: the size of the second test set.

  Returns:
  Three datasets are created:
  * train: consists of pairs of user,item embeddings and their label. User and
           item embeddings are drawn from a fixed set of <num_user> and
           <num_items> embeddings
  * test:  same as train but with the constraint that train and test do not
           overlap
  * fresh: same as train but using fresh embeddings, i.e., embeddings are not
           limited to the <num_user> and <num_items> embeddings from train and
           test
