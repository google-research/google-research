    name: a string
    nonpadding: optional Tensor with shape [batch_size, encoder_length]
      indicating what positions are not padding.  This is used to mask out
      padding in convolutional layers.  We generally only need this mask for
      "packed" datasets, because for ordinary datasets, no padding is ever
      followed by nonpadding.
    save_weights_to: an optional dictionary to capture attention weights for
      visualization; the weights tensor will be appended there under a string
      key created from the variable scope (including name).
    make_image_summary: Whether to make an attention image summary.
    losses: optional list onto which to append extra training losses
    layer_collection: A tensorflow_kfac.LayerCollection. Only used by the KFAC
      optimizer. Default is None.
    recurrent_memory_by_layer: Optional dict, mapping layer names to instances
      of transformer_memory.RecurrentMemory. Default is None.
    chunk_number: an optional integer Tensor with shape [batch] used to operate
      the recurrent_memory.
