Typically, these sorts of control algorithms either rely on planning methods or reinforcement learning methods, both of which have limitations. Planning algorithms can reason over long horizons, but cannot deal with high-dimensional observations. Reinforcement learning algorithms fail to plan over long distances. *SoRB* attempts to combine the best of both algorithms.\n",
