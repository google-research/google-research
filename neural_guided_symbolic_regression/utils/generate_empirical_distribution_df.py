r"""Generates empirical distribution dataframe of next production rule.

There are two different empirical distribution dataframes we can generate. One
is the empirical distribution of the next production rule for a partial
sequence, and the other is the empirical distribution of the next production
rule for the tail of a partial sequence. "Tail" means that we just use the last
several production rules from the partial sequence. It uses limited history (or
called partial information) to determine the next production rule.

Each row of the dataframe contains a string of partial sequence indices (or tail
of it), and the conditions of the complete sequence (such as leading power at
zero and leading power at inf). These are placed as multi-indices of the
dataframe. The columns of the dataframe are the probabilities of the next
production rule.

Here is an example of the first kind of dataframe:
partial_sequence_indices  leading_at_0  leading_at_inf  0  1  2   ...
        1_4_3_5                -1            -1         0  0  0.5 ...

Here is an example of the second kind of dataframe with tail_length=2:
tail_partial_sequence_indices  leading_at_0  leading_at_inf  0  1  2   ...
            3_5                     -1            -1         0  0  0.5 ...

How is the dataframe computed:
For each given string of partial sequence indices (or tail of it) and
conditions, find all the matches from the training set. This gives a number of
next production rules. Compute the empirical distribution of these production
rules. Note that for the tail partial sequence, the next production rule mask of
the entire sequence is needed to ensure the validity of the proposed next
production rule.
