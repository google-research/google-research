"""Postprocessor functions convert expression array to expression string.

The autoencoder model uses feature_preprocessors API from model_ops.ModelBase to
convert expression string input to expression tensor. The decoder model will
output the reconstructed expression tensor. However, the model_ops.ModelBase
does not have postprocessor API. This module includes postprocessor functions
and can be used in the model_fn of the autoencoder model.
