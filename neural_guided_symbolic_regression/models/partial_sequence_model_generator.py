"""Generates full sequences of expressions by trained partial sequence model.

Model trained in run_partial_sequence_model.py predicts the next production rule
from partial sequence and conditions.

To generate expressions, the partial sequence model is loaded from a given
checkpoint. The generation starts from partial sequence of length 1, predicts
the next production rule. The next production rule will be appended to the
current partial sequence. The new partial sequence of length 2 will be used as
an new input, and the model will predict the next production rule. The next
production rule will be appended to the current partial sequence to form a new
partial sequence of length 3. This process will be repeated until all symbols
are terminal.
