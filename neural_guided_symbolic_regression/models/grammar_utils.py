  r"""Gets the number of expressions within maximum number of production rules.

  The context-free grammar has two non-terminal symbols, S and T.
  When the left hand side symbol is S, the right hand side symbols can be
  non-terminal symbols (S, T) or T.
  When the left hand side symbol is T, the right hand side symbols can be
  non-terminal symbol S or terminal symbols.

  We denote
  s_to_s_t: number of production rules S -> S T
  s_to_t: number of production rules S -> T
  t_to_s: number of production rules T -> S
  t_to_terminal: number of production rules T -> terminal symbols

  For example, for grammar
  S -> S '+' T
  S -> S '-' T
  S -> S '*' T
  S -> S '/' T
  S -> T
  T -> '(' S ')'
  T -> 'x'
  T -> '1'

  s_to_s_t = 4
  s_to_t = 1
  t_to_s = 1
  t_to_terminal = 2

  We define n_s[i] and n_t[i] as the number of expressions for a production rule
  sequence with maximum length i starting with S and T respectively.

  Here is the recursive relation:
  n_s[i] = s_to_s_t * \sum_{p=0,...,i - 1} n_s[p] * n_t[i - 1 - p]
           + s_to_t * n_t[i - 1]
  n_t[i] = t_to_s * n_s[i - 1] + t_to_terminal

  Ground case:
  n_s[0] = 1
  n_t[0] = 1

  This function will return n_s[max_num_production_rules].

  Note this function also counts the non-terminal expressions.

  Args:
    s_to_s_t: Integer, number of production rules S -> S T
    s_to_t: Integer, number of production rules S -> T
    t_to_s: Integer, number of production rules T -> S
    t_to_terminal: Integer, number of production rules T -> terminal symbols
    max_num_production_rules: Integer, the maximum number of production rules
        in sequence.

  Returns:

    starting with non-terminal symbol S.
