"""Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm.

This module defines the node and operations for MCTS.

Introduction to Monte Carlo Tree Search:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search

Each trial of Monte Carlo tree search consists of four steps:

* Selection: Start from root and select successive child nodes down to a leaf
    node.
* Expansion: Unless the selected leaf node is terminal state, expand the
    selected node.
* Simulation: Start from the current state in the node, recursively simulate to
    the next state until terminal state. Get the reward score from the terminal
    state. This step is sometimes also called rollout. It is worth to note that
    another choice is to use a heuristic function or a neural network to
    evaluate the reward score of a non-terminal state without rollout.
    For example,

    "Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search",
    Nature 2016
    Used a mix of rollout and reward directly from neural network as the
    simulation result.

    "Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge", Nature 2017
    Used a neural network alone to get the simulation result without rollout.

* Backpropagation: Update the reward score from the leaf node started the
    simulation to the parent node recursively.
